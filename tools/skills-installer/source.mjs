/**
 * Resolve the Skill tree this command installs from.
 *
 * Two sources, in this order:
 *
 *   1. A tree that already contains `skills/`. That covers both ordinary
 *      cases: `npx github:PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S` clones the repository before
 *      running this file, and the published npm package ships `skills/` inside
 *      it (about 6.4 MiB packed). Either way the common path needs no network
 *      at all and installs the bytes npm just fetched.
 *   2. The source tarball at codeload.github.com, extracted into a cache
 *      directory. This is the `--remote` / `--repo` / `--ref` path -- a
 *      specific commit, a branch newer than the installed package, a fork --
 *      and the fallback when neither tree above is present.
 *
 * What the manifest records about a download is what was actually verified:
 * the ref asked for, the URL, and the SHA-256 of the bytes received. It does
 * not record a commit SHA, because resolving a branch to a commit would be a
 * second request whose answer this code never checks against the tarball it
 * unpacked. Pass `--ref <commit-sha>` for an install that is reproducible by
 * construction.
