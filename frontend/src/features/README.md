# frontend/src/features

[中文说明](README_zh.md)

Lane-owned feature modules. Each F-series item adds its own subdirectory and does not edit another lane's files.
Per-lane domain modules. F-08 adds the pure-function kernels; later items add `components/<area>/` and `islands/` beside this tree, and only import `stores/` (F-05) rather than editing it.

## Subdirectories
