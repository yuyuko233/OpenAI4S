"""Collect what routes really return, and freeze it.

Nothing here runs in production, and nothing in the gateway was changed to
support it. The capture wraps ``make_handler``'s ``_api`` from the outside and
watches the response body on its way to ``_json``. That placement is not
incidental: the gateway tests replace ``handler._json`` with their own
collector, so a hook installed *inside* the real ``_json`` would have missed
almost every route the suite exercises while looking like it worked.

The grouping key is ``METHOD /route/pattern``, not the concrete path a request
happened to use. ``/frames/f-abc123/kernel`` and ``/frames/f-def456/kernel``
are one route observed twice, and treating them as two would produce a file
that grows with the fixtures rather than with the surface.

#: Subtrees that describe the machine rather than the API. A response may
#: embed a live kernel environment snapshot, and inside it the sandbox block
#: reports what the host can actually enforce: on a developer's macOS it is
#: `backend: "seatbelt", warning: null`, and on a CI runner with no bubblewrap
#: it is `backend: null, warning: "<why>"`. The *types* legitimately differ, so
#: freezing that shape pins the machine the capture ran on and calls every
#: other machine a breaking change. Recorded opaquely: the field is still known
#: to exist, its interior is not a promise.
#:
#: Add to this only for a subtree whose type varies with the host. It is not a
#: place to park a route whose shape is merely inconvenient -- that is what the
#: coverage number is for.
#: Property names whose *shape* describes the machine rather than the API.
#:
#: `sandbox` was the first: its field types differ between a host that can
#: enforce a sandbox and one that cannot. `default_host` is the same thing one
#: level down — the registry documents it as ``"<alias>" | null``, so which of
#: the two you observe depends on whether this machine has an ssh alias
#: configured, not on the contract. Freezing it as `string` pinned the
#: developer's ssh config and told CI, which has none, that the API had made a
#: breaking change.
#: `gpu_name` and `cuda_version` are the third instance of the same thing, and
#: the local GPU probe is as host-dependent as a field gets: on a machine with
#: nvidia-smi they are strings, and on one without — every CI runner here —
#: they are null. Freezing either answer calls the other machine a breaking
#: change. `_detect_gpu` was made to return a constant *key* set for the same
#: reason (see gateway.py), because eliding a value cannot rescue a shape whose
#: required list moves; these two are the part that genuinely varies.
#:
#: Both names are unique to `GET /compute/gpu` in the frozen document, which is
#: what makes eliding them by name safe. `note`, which also appears there, is
#: deliberately *not* here: it is shared with `/environments/status` and
#: `/kernel/packages`, and eliding by name is depth-blind, so listing it would
#: quietly drop two unrelated routes' contracts as well.
_MACHINE_STATE_KEYS = frozenset({"sandbox", "default_host", "gpu_name", "cuda_version"})

#: A different failure that looks like the one above, and must not be fixed the
#: same way.
#:
#: `merge` widens across observations, so a nullable field ends up `["null",
#: "string"]` *if the suite observes it both ways*. A field the suite only ever
#: sees in one state freezes as that state alone -- and the resulting entry
#: describes the run, not the API. `POST /example/session` was the first one
#: caught: its `error` is `str | None` straight from `last_error()`, but the
#: suite observed it exactly once, immediately after `start()` cleared the error
#: and spawned a thread that may or may not have failed yet. Both threads then
#: contend for one lock, so the field froze as `string` on Linux/CI and `null`
#: on macOS, and the gate called the other machine a breaking change.
#:
#: The fix is a test that exercises the other state, never an entry here. These
#: fields are not host-dependent -- they are *under-observed*, and eliding them
#: would delete a real guarantee to silence a coverage gap. A survey at the time
#: of writing found 94 fields frozen as null-only across 43 route entries
#: (`frame_id` on both `/example/session` verbs among them); each is a latent
#: version of this, waiting for the first capture that sees the populated state.

#: How many incompatibilities to name per route before summarising the rest.
#: One structural change can break dozens of nested fields, and a wall of them
#: buries the first one, which is usually the cause of all the others.

    freezes as refusal-only, and the two here were found by auditing the

    Most of this file's routes are frame-scoped, and the parameterless sweep
    probes them with an id shaped like a real one that names nothing. Every one
    of them answered 404, and 404 became their published contract -- so the
    artifact described how thirty routes refuse and said nothing about what
    they return. A client generating against it would have had no shape for the
    Timeline, the execution queue, the branch list or the recovery journal.

    The fixture is the one `_drive_seeded_downloads` already built, extended
    with the rows each group needs, and every response here is a real one: a
    real checkpoint over a real workspace tree, a real fork, a real revert and
    its real undo. Nothing is stubbed, because a fabricated 200 in a file whose
    entire claim is "captured from real responses" is worse than an absent one.

    What is deliberately *not* here, and why -- each needs something this
    process cannot honestly produce, so their refusal-only entries stand as the
    truth about what can be observed offline rather than being papered over:

    * `compute/tasks/<id>/refresh` contacts a real BYOC provider. There is no
      read-only probe; the refresh *is* the harvest.
    * `delegations/<id>/stop` and `/steer` resolve a live in-process delegation
      runner, which exists only during a real LLM turn.
    * `kernel/*` answers 403 under the deny-by-default posture, and that 403 is
      the contract for an unapproved session rather than a gap in it.
    * `artifacts/promote` needs a cell that really executed.
