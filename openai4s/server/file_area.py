"""The team file area: allowlisted roots, traversal-safe resolution (M1-8).

`OPENAI4S_DATA_ROOTS` names the only directories the file routes may touch
(decision D8: a read-only datasets area, project workspaces, personal
scratch — whatever the operator mounts). Empty means the whole feature is
dormant and the routes answer their stable "not configured" shape.

The security core is one function: :meth:`FileArea.resolve` takes the
client-supplied path, resolves it (symlinks and ``..`` included), and
requires the result to sit under one of the resolved roots — the containment
check runs on the *resolved* path, so a symlink pointing outside a root is
refused even though its own name sits inside one. Everything else (listing,
download, upload) goes through it first.

Upload targets get one extra rule: the *parent* must resolve into a root and
the final name must be a plain filename — no separators, no dot-dot, not a
symlink hop — so an upload can create a new file without being usable to
reach outside.
