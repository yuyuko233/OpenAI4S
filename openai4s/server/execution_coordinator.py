"""Web adapter for session-scoped FIFO execution ownership.

The protocol-neutral coordinator owns admission and ticket state.  This module
adds the small amount of Web-runtime policy that does not belong in Gateway:

* project ticket state onto WebSocket-friendly events;
* bind one admitted ticket to its cancellation event and current kernel lease;
* interrupt only the exact lease owned by the exact execution id; and
* expose a ``finalizing`` projection between scientific work and completion.

It deliberately does not import Gateway, kernels, or the HTTP server.  The
caller supplies the event and interrupt ports so the admission algorithm stays
directly testable.
