"""Session-local admission for Artifact writers and truthful Stage 1 capture.

Foreground capture diffs one shared workspace.  A background kernel or a
person-facing Artifact mutation that is allowed to write during that interval
makes authorship unknowable: its bytes can be swept up as output of the
foreground Cell or native action.  This coordinator gives those lifetimes one
small, deterministic boundary.

The lock protects counters only; it is never held while a Cell or background
job runs.  Capture leases may nest (a foreground Cell can synchronously run a
delegated child), background leases may coexist, and external-mutation leases
may nest only on their owning thread.  Background and external-mutation leases
are always active because they protect one mutable workspace even before Stage
1 is enabled.  Capture leases join that exclusion only when Stage 1 is enabled.
Admission and counter increment happen under the same lock, so there is no
check-then-start window for the losing side to enter.
