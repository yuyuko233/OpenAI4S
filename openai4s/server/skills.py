#: missing is that the *gateway* then answered 200, so these never reached
#: `errors.public_failure` and carried neither a stable `code` nor the
#: `request_id` that ties a user's report to a log line. Worse, `api()` in the
#: web client only throws on a non-2xx, so the Customize skill editor reported
#: "saved" and closed the modal on a save that had not happened.
