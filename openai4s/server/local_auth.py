"""The daemon's own access token: minted once, owner-readable, reused.

The gateway used to mint `secrets.token_hex(16)` into a closure local and print
it. Nothing persisted it, so the token changed on every restart and every
cookie issued before the restart became invalid — which is tolerable for a
gate that is off by default and intolerable for one that is on.

It also lives here rather than in `gateway.py` because the CLI needs to read
the same value: with the gate required, every `openai4s` subcommand that talks
to the daemon has to present a credential, and the two must agree on where it
is kept without the CLI importing the web server.

Pure stdlib, and deliberately a file rather than a Store row: the CLI can read
it before any database exists, and `openai4s doctor` has to work when the
database is the thing that is broken.

    Concurrent minters settle on exactly one token. The candidate is written
    into a temporary in the same directory, fsynced, and published with
    `os.link` onto the final name: the link is the one operation that can only
    succeed once, so a single process creates the token and everybody else
    gets EEXIST and reads what that winner wrote.

    This used to be a read, then a mint, then an *unconditional* `os.replace`,
    which meant every racer won. Each overwrote the file, and each re-read
    outside any exclusion, so N daemons starting together held N different
    tokens with only the last write on disk -- a daemon authorising cookies
    against a value the CLI could no longer read. `os.replace` cannot pick the
    winner here precisely because it never fails on a name already taken; only
    an exclusive create can.

    Publishing through a link is also what makes "the loser re-reads" true
    rather than hopeful: the content is complete *before* the final name
    exists, so a loser's read cannot land on an empty or half-written file --
    which an `O_EXCL` create on the final path itself would leave open for as
    long as the winner takes to write and fsync.
