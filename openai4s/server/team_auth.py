"""Team-mode authentication service: login, identity, and rate limiting.

The gateway's team guard (active only when ``OPENAI4S_TEAM_MODE`` is on)
resolves every request to a :class:`TeamIdentity` before routing. Two ways in:

* a browser presents the ``os_user`` cookie, minted by ``POST /auth/login``
  and stored server-side as sha256 only (storage/team.py);
* the management CLI on the server presents the daemon access token over a
  loopback connection (``X-OpenAI4S-Token`` / ``Authorization: Bearer``) and
  gets the synthetic *service* identity — admin-equivalent, but named ``cli``
  in the audit trail so a human account and the machine path stay separable.

Login attempts are rate limited with a token bucket per (username, client ip):
capacity ``LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_PER_MINUTE``, refilling at the same rate. The bucket
is in-memory by design — a restart forgets it, which costs an attacker nothing
useful (the PBKDF2 cost per guess dwarfs it) and keeps this module free of
storage concerns.

Every login outcome is audited (INV-12): success, bad credentials, and
rate-limited refusals alike.
