"""Who may touch what, in one place (M2/M4 hardening).

An external review named the real problem with the first version of team
mode: authorization was "does this path match one of two regexes", so
every surface that is not `/frames/{id}` or `/projects/{id}/…` was still
the single-user API. Five separate isolation defects came out of that one
shape — a project self-join, global share administration, project-scoped
memory reached by query parameter, a cross-user file clobber, and an
instance-global LLM config any member could rewrite.

Point-fixing five call sites would reproduce the cause. What is here
instead is the *decisions*, as functions over resources rather than over
URLs: may this identity administer this project, use this share, read
this memory scope, write this file, change instance-global configuration.
The call sites still have to ask — nothing can force a new route to — but
there is now one model to read, one place a rule changes, and one file a
reviewer can hold the whole policy in their head from.

Two properties every predicate here keeps:

**Team mode off is not a policy question.** Every entry point returns the
permissive answer immediately when there is no identity, so a single-user
install runs the code it always ran (INV-1). The guards are not "disabled"
in that mode; they are not reached.

**Undecidable means refused.** A lookup that raises is not an open door.
The alternative — treating an unreadable ownership row as unrestricted —
is how a version-addressed artifact walked past this product's checks
once already.
