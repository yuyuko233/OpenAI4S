"""Deterministic, untrusted-safe scientific Session packages.

The package is deliberately a data interchange boundary, not a database dump.
It contains the canonical durable projections needed to inspect and recover a
session, but never settings, connector launch configuration, credentials,
pending approval payloads, daemon ownership, or a live Kernel namespace.

Import validates the entire archive before creating anything.  It then creates
new project/session identities, remaps cross-record references, restores only
safe regular files into the new private workspace, and leaves an ended Kernel
generation as an explicit view-only/recovery boundary.
