    detail that tells a user whether it is their key, their model name or their
    network". The concern is right and this answers it -- by branching on
    `status` and `error_code`, which `TransportError` sets deliberately
    (`llm/models.py`), rather than on the provider's prose.

    `redact_text` is not sufficient here and `errors.py` already removed it for
    this reason. Measured on a 403 body: a credential-shaped token is replaced,
    but `10.4.2.17:8443`, `/Users/<name>/.certs/corp-ca.pem` and
    `org-Acme-Research-Lab` all survive. The redaction is shape-based and a
    provider body carries more than credentials -- an absolute path with the
    account name on it, internal network topology, private model identifiers --
    into a 200 body and the Customize -> Models panel.

    `gateway._friendly_error` solved exactly this for the turn path and its

        usable" for every profile at zero network cost and with no chance of a
        page load spending someone's API quota or waking a rate limiter.

        Reachability is deliberately *not* here. It cannot be known without a
        request, and a request is a thing the user asks for (see `probe`). A
        readiness card that quietly probed on render would be exactly the
        implicit outbound call this version spent P0-1 removing.

        session run under", and the revisions live in the row's own JSON blob, so
        deleting the row deleted the history of every session that ran on it. The

        `POST /frames/{id}/model-binding`. Clearing the pin instead made the next
        send silently re-pin somewhere else, which is the silent substitution D2
