"""Response shapes, derived from real responses rather than from route code.

The Contract scorecard wants the external surface covered by schema. The
obvious route -- generate it from the routing chain -- has an expensive
prerequisite: ``Handler._api`` is one method of ~2000 lines and ~150 branches,
with response bodies assembled inline, so nothing can be read off it until it
is decomposed. That decomposition is worth doing and is not a prerequisite for
having schemas.

So the dependency is inverted. Every JSON response leaves through a single
method, so what a route *actually returns* can be observed while the suite
exercises it, generalised into a shape, and frozen. Two consequences worth
stating plainly:

* a schema derived from real responses cannot drift from reality the way a
  hand-maintained one does -- if it disagrees, one of them is a bug and the
  test says which;
* coverage is partial at first, and *measurable*. A route no test exercises
  has no schema, which is a fact worth surfacing rather than a gap to hide.

Deliberately not JSON Schema draft-2020-12, and deliberately no dependency.
The core is stdlib-only, so this is a small, explicit subset: types, required
keys, and element shapes. It answers "did this response change shape", which
is the question the contract needs. It does not answer "is this valid against
an arbitrary published schema", and it does not pretend to.
