"""BatchJob routes: submit / list / detail / cancel / logs (plan M3a-8).

Same shape as the other route groups: a validated `RouteSpec` table shared
with the contract inventory, and a tri-state `handle()`.

Ownership is the same rule sessions use — a workload belongs to whoever
submitted it, an admin sees everything, and someone else's workload answers
404 rather than 403, because which jobs exist is itself information about
what a colleague is working on.

Two things this module deliberately does NOT do. It never submits: it writes
a durable row and lets the reconciler do the talking, so a cancel survives a
daemon restart and a submission is never attempted twice from a request
thread. And it never names a scheduler — `profile` is a name from
cluster.toml, and the response carries `allocation_id`, never a job id
(INV-2).
