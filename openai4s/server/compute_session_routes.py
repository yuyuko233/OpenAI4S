"""Where a session's kernel runs, and whether it is ready yet (M3b-6).

Three routes, same shape as the other groups: a validated `RouteSpec`
table shared with the contract inventory and a tri-state `handle()`.

The response these exist for is `readiness`. A session on a cluster is not
one boolean but four conditions (INV-5), and the UI needs to say *which*
one is outstanding — "queued for a node", "waiting for the worker to dial
in" and "starting the kernel" are three different waits with three
different expected durations, and a single spinner for all of them is how
a user decides the product is broken.

`state_lost_epochs` is the other reason. When a node dies the kernel's
memory dies with it: variables, imports, the seed somebody set three cells
ago. The session continues on a new epoch, and the UI must say so (INV-11)
— a banner, not a log line — because the results afterwards look exactly
like the results from the session that was lost.

Nothing here names a scheduler. A run location is `local` or a profile
name from cluster.toml, and what the response carries is `allocation_id`.
