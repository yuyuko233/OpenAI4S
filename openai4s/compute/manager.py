"""Host-side remote-compute transport.

The worker's ``host.compute`` SDK routes every call to
``host_call("compute_<op>", [kw])``; the dispatcher forwards those here. This
module owns the real work the SDK only describes:

  * provider discovery — scan ``skills/remote-compute-<id>/provider.json`` for
    an ``id`` and a ``provider.py`` that exports ``PROVIDER``.
  * byoc transport      — spawn the confined ``openai4s_compute_provider``
    helper (oneshot mode) per op, staging inputs/outputs through a temp dir and
    handing the credential on the helper's stdin so the process environment is
    never a secret carrier.
  * ssh transport       — run a job script / one-off command over an SSH alias.
  * on-demand harvest   — ``result()`` polls the remote and unpacks terminal
    outputs into ``hpc/<job_id>/``.

Two provider families share one manager:
  "byoc:<id>"  bring-your-own-compute sandbox (e.g. "byoc:nvidia").
  "ssh:<alias>" a job over an existing SSH connection.

Terminal states are mutually exclusive and never optimistic — the vocabulary
and its transition table live in ``compute/states.py`` and are enforced when a
status is written. ``succeeded`` requires evidence on both halves: a verified
rc==0 *and* every declared output harvested and hashed. A job that exits 0
while a pattern it declared in ``outputs`` matched nothing is ``failed`` with
``termination_reason: outputs_unverified``.

``unknown`` means the outcome could not be established. It is *not* a synonym
for failure, it must never be resolved to success by default, and it counts as
live — something may be running out there, and forgetting it is how a sandbox
bills unnoticed. Every path that cannot produce an exit code lands there
deliberately.

Jobs are durable. A remote job outlives this process — an ssh job keeps running
under ``nohup``, a byoc sandbox keeps billing — so every job is recorded in
``compute_jobs`` before it is submitted, its provider receipt (remote pid /
sandbox id) is stored on acknowledgement, and every transition appends to a
sequenced ``compute_job_events`` stream. A restart rehydrates whatever was live
and ``reconcile()`` surfaces it; nothing is resubmitted automatically, because
a job in ``submitted`` may or may not be running and guessing wrong costs either
a duplicate charge or a lost result.

Known limit, stated so it is not mistaken for a guarantee: no OS boundary is
applied to the byoc helper — see ``confinement_status``.

        group, and only ``kill -- -<pgid>`` reaches it.
      * the pgid was *assumed* to equal ``$!``. It does not in a
        non-interactive login shell, so the group being signalled frequently
        did not exist. This script is now handed the group the host itself
        reported at submit.
      * a process that ignores SIGTERM was never escalated to SIGKILL.
      * nothing checked afterwards. The final ``kill -0`` is what makes the
        non-zero exit — and therefore the caller's ``unknown_state`` — mean
        "we looked, and it is still there".

    ``pid`` is the job's own process, signalled alongside the group as a belt:

        Returns ``(error, oversized, stayed, transient)``: an error string or

        ceiling, the ones left behind because the caller declared
        ``residency: remote``, and whether the error was a *transport* failure
        rather than a verdict about the archive.

        That last flag is not cosmetic. The job's own outcome and our ability to
        copy its files back are separate facts, and collapsing them wrote a
        terminal ``failed`` with an empty manifest whenever a transfer timed out

        returned that row forever, though the archive and the work directory
        were still sitting on the remote. A transient error therefore reports
        itself as one, and the caller retries instead of recording a verdict.

        This used to copy ``stdout.log`` and ``stderr.log`` and nothing else,
        while ``submit_job`` accepted an ``outputs`` declaration and the
        bundled skill's worked example declares one. Every declared pattern

        that had exited 0 having written exactly what it promised was forced to
        ``failed``. The documented submit → poll → harvest path could not
        succeed at all on this transport.

        The archive is built remotely and extracted through the same
        hostile-input-safe extractor the byoc path uses, because the bytes come
