"""Minimal MCP (Model Context Protocol) client — pure stdlib.

Speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 to a spawned MCP server process, or lazily
dispatches to the Streamable HTTP sibling transport, enough to power the
Connectors control plane: handshake (initialize + initialized), tools, resources,
and prompts. A process-wide MCPManager caches one live connection per connector
id and non-secret runtime scope so repeated calls reuse the same logical server
session without sharing a credential-bound session across Store generations.

Sampling and server-initiated requests are deliberately outside this client.

    """One newline-delimited line at a time, bounded in bytes that are real.

    The predecessor counted characters off a ``text=True`` pipe against a
    constant named ``_MAX_FRAME_BYTES``, which is two different problems
    wearing one number. A four-million-character line of three-byte characters
    is twelve megabytes, not four -- and it accumulated them in a ``list`` of
    four million single-character strings, each with a ``str`` object's fifty-
    odd bytes of overhead, so the peak allocation for one frame *at the limit*
    was some hundreds of megabytes. The bound was respected and meant nothing.

    Reading the pipe raw fixes both at once: the budget is bytes because bytes
    are what arrive, and they land in a ``bytearray`` that grows by the chunk
    rather than by the character. Decoding happens once, on a buffer already
    known to be within budget.

    An over-budget *frame* is dropped rather than truncated -- half a JSON
    object is not a frame, and returning it would desynchronise the next read.
    ``keep_partial`` is for stderr, where there is no frame to desynchronise
    and a truncated prefix is still the diagnostic the user needs.

    ``frames_dropped`` / ``bytes_dropped`` exist because the refusal used to be
    invisible. A dropped frame came back as ``""``, the read loop skipped it as
    it skips a blank line, and the only thing the caller ever saw was its own
    deadline expiring -- so a connector that answered promptly and too largely
    was reported, and torn down, as one that did not answer at all.
