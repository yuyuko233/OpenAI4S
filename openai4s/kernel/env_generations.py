"""Environments as a transaction: plan, apply into a new generation, or roll back.

`openai4s setup` installed *in place*. `conda env create` into an existing name
either refuses or, with `--update`, mutates the environment the running kernels
are using — so an interrupted or failed update left a half-changed environment
that nothing could describe, and there was no previous state to return to. An
artifact's environment provenance can name a generation only if generations
exist.

The model, decided by the owner:

* **plan** produces a change plan and touches nothing;
* **apply** builds a *new* generation, verifies it, and only then moves the
  current pointer;
* a failed apply leaves the current environment exactly as it was;
* **rollback** is a pointer move back to a generation that is still on disk;
* an applied generation is immutable — nothing is ever rewritten in place.

## Why the pointer is a file and the swap is a rename

``os.replace`` is atomic on POSIX and on Windows, so a reader either sees the
whole old pointer or the whole new one — never a truncated file, and never a
directory mid-rebuild. The alternative, mutating a well-known prefix, has no
instant at which the change is complete: a kernel spawning during the write
gets an environment that is neither.

## Layout

    <data_dir>/environments/<name>/
        current                       # one line: the active generation id
        generations/<id>/
            manifest.json             # spec hash, tool, state, packages, times
            prefix/                   # the environment itself
        history.jsonl                 # append-only, what happened and when

The environment is built **at its final prefix**, not in a staging directory
that is renamed — Conda bakes the absolute prefix into scripts, activation
hooks and package metadata, so a relocated environment is broken. What is made
atomic is instead the generation's *visibility*: ``manifest.json`` is written
last, and the ``current`` pointer is flipped last. While a build is in flight
the directory holds a ``building.json`` and no manifest, so ``get``/``list``
ignore it and discovery never serves it; a crash therefore leaves something
visibly not a generation, cleaned up by ``recover``/``discard``.

    other ``LOCK_EX`` on the same inode — across processes *and* across threads
    that opened it independently — and the kernel releases the lock the instant
    the holding process dies.

    That retires the entire stale-lock heuristic, and with it three rounds of
    reclaim races. A plain ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL`` marker has no holder the kernel
    understands, so any ``rename``/``replace`` could lift a live owner's lock
    and leave two applies in the section at once; no amount of mtime-staleness
    checking could make "lift only if truly dead" atomic with plain files. A
    ``flock`` cannot be lifted by anyone but its holder or the holder's death,
    so no third racer can win the slot from under an owner.

    The lock file is created but never unlinked. It is a stable inode to lock,
    not the lock itself — unlinking it while a holder lives would let a later
    ``O_CREAT`` mint a *different* inode a second process could lock in
    parallel, the classic ``flock``/``unlink`` race. A leftover file with no
    live holder is harmless: the next applier simply locks it.
