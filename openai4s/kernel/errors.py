"""Kernel exception types, in a module that imports nothing.

`KernelInterruptUnavailable` has to be catchable by `KernelSupervisor`, and
the supervisor is reachable from `manager` through the watchdog -- so
defining it in `manager` and importing it from `supervisor` closes a cycle
that only fails on the import orders where `manager` happens to be
initialised first. A leaf module is the fix that does not depend on which
module some future caller reaches first.

    later attempt that would work. Its own type because every caller of

    `interrupted: true` for a cell still running on the cluster.
