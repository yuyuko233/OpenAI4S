"""Sanitized environment construction for scientific kernel workers.

Kernel code is intentionally powerful, but it must not inherit credentials
owned by the daemon.  Build the worker environment from a small, explicit
allowlist instead of copying :data:`os.environ`: LLM/provider keys, cloud
tokens, OAuth material, password/credential variables, agent sockets, and
dynamic-loader injection settings therefore never cross the process boundary.

The resulting mapping is also inherited by subprocesses launched from a cell
(including ``host.bash``), unless the cell explicitly obtains and injects a
credential through a Host broker.  This module is pure stdlib and contains no
protocol or process-lifecycle code.
