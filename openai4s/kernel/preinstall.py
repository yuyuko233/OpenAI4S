"""Kernel package pre-installation + on-demand install.

The persistent kernel is spawned with ``sys.executable`` (see kernel/manager.py),
so every package importable by the daemon's interpreter is available to agent
cells.  Historically the agent had to ``pip install`` a package mid-task and then
had no way to get a fresh kernel — this module fixes both halves:

  * ``core_plan()`` reports what the scientific stack is missing WITHOUT
    touching the environment. This is what daemon startup calls.

  * ``ensure_core()`` installs that plan. It runs only when a human or an
    explicit API asks — never as a side effect of ``openai4s serve``.

  * ``install(packages)`` performs an on-demand install (used by the
    ``POST /api/kernel/install`` endpoint and the ``host.pip_install`` tool). The
    caller then restarts the session kernel (kernel/manager.py ``Kernel.restart``)
    so the new package is picked up by a clean process.

Startup does not install. It used to: ``serve`` fired ``ensure_core`` on a
daemon thread, which resolved ~23 unpinned package names against PyPI and
installed them with ``--break-system-packages`` into whatever interpreter the
daemon happened to run under. That made three things true that should not be:
starting the daemon mutated the user's Python environment, what you got
depended on what PyPI served that day, and a cold start off the network failed
in a background thread nobody was watching. Diagnosing and installing are now
separate: startup reports, the user decides.

Homebrew / distro pythons are PEP-668 "externally managed"; installs pass
``--break-system-packages`` (a harmless no-op on unmanaged envs) so an
explicitly requested install works in the environments this daemon runs in.
That flag is why the implicit-at-startup behaviour was worth removing rather
than merely narrowing: it is exactly the flag that makes an unattended install
capable of stepping on a system interpreter.
