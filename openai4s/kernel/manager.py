    inherit the main thread's empty signal mask. When one of those consumes
    the SIGINT, CPython's C trampoline only sets a flag -- the Python-level
    handler runs on the main thread alone -- and a main thread blocked in

    thread set. Observed on a CI runner as a cell that slept its remaining

    ``hrtimer_nanosleep``, then reported ``interrupted=True`` at wall=30.0005

    the sleep expired on its own.

    tgkill directs the signal at one thread; the main thread's tid equals the

    path: the ``sh -c 'exec ...'`` spawn keeps pid == R's main thread.
