"""How a Kernel reaches its worker: pipes locally, a socket across a cluster.

The manager's protocol discipline — one frame reader, id-routed
`host_response`, the host-call transaction lock — is unchanged by this file
and must stay that way. What moves here is only *how bytes get to the other
end*, so that a worker running on a compute node is the same conversation
over a different pipe.

`PipeTransport` is the local path, moved rather than rewritten: the Popen
call, the stderr drain thread and the shutdown sequence are the ones that
were in `manager.py`, with their comments, because each of them records a
failure that was paid for once already (a filled stderr pipe deadlocking a
cell; a daemon thread parked in a buffered read turning a clean exit into
SIGABRT; a restart leaking a zombie).

`OutboundTcpTransport` is the remote path: the daemon listens, the worker
dials in from wherever the scheduler put it, and the connection is accepted
only after it proves it holds a credential this daemon issued. Two
properties are deliberate:

* **It listens, the worker dials.** A compute node is usually reachable from
  nothing; the daemon usually is. Making the worker the client means no
  inbound firewall rule on the cluster and no address for the daemon to
  guess.
* **An unauthenticated connection is closed, never served.** The socket
  carries `host_call` traffic, which is arbitrary Host RPC. A transport that
  accepted first and checked later would be a remote execution surface for
  the duration of "later".

Interrupt is the one operation that does not survive the move unchanged. A
SIGINT to a local child is a signal to a pid this process owns; there is no
such pid across a cluster, so the remote transport takes an explicit hook
(the scheduler's own signal delivery) and reports honestly when it has none
— rather than returning success for something that did not happen.

    A POSIX shell starts background jobs (`./start.sh &`, `nohup openai4s
    serve`) with SIGINT and SIGQUIT set to SIG_IGN, and SIG_IGN — unlike a
    handler — survives every exec in the chain: daemon → [bwrap] → sh →
    Rscript. R follows the classic Unix idiom and installs its interrupt
    handler only when the inherited disposition is not SIG_IGN, so a worker
    descended from a backgrounded daemon is born uninterruptible:
    `Kernel.interrupt()`'s SIGINT is discarded in the child (verified with
    lldb — sigaction(SIGINT)=SIG_IGN, R_interrupts_pending stays 0) and the
    cell runs to completion while the caller reports a delivered stop. The
    python worker survives the same inheritance only because worker.py calls
    `signal.signal()` unconditionally.

    Resetting to SIG_DFL here makes every kernel worker start as if launched
    from a foreground shell, without touching the daemon's own disposition —
    an operator who backgrounded the daemon keeps its terminal semantics. The
    reset cannot live in r_kernel's sh wrapper instead: POSIX forbids a
    non-interactive shell from trapping or resetting a signal that was
    ignored on entry, so `trap - INT` is a no-op exactly when it is needed.

    `signal.signal` is legal in this child even when the Popen ran on a
    daemon request thread: with a preexec_fn CPython runs
    `PyOS_AfterFork_Child()` first, which re-mains the surviving thread.
