"""Persistent Python kernel worker for openai4s.

Implements the hard parts of a robust in-process kernel protocol:

 dup2 fd swap....... the REAL protocol stdin/stdout are moved to high,
 non-inheritable fds and PUBLISHED on sys._openai4s_protocol_stdin/stdout;
 fd 1 (stdout) is aliased to stderr (dup2(2,1)) so any raw C-level write or
 stray print lands in stderr, never on the protocol wire. Consumers
 RE-RESOLVE the published handles on every call (never cache) so a crash
 recovery that republishes is seen by everyone.
 two locks......... _PROTOCOL_WRITE_LOCK (held only while writing a frame,
 shared by worker responses + SDK host_calls) and _HOST_CALL_LOCK (held for
 a whole host_call request/response transaction so only one RPC is in flight
 and the readline that returns is provably ours).
 15MB wire cap + bounded (8) discard desync guard.
 SIGINT discipline. one-shot self-clearing handler, _in_user_code gating,
 _sigint_delivered distinguishes a DELIVERED signal (interrupted=True,
 lineno=None) from a user `raise KeyboardInterrupt` (normal error w/ lineno).
 crash recovery.... before AND after each blocking protocol read we verify
 the fd's (st_dev, st_ino) still matches the identity recorded at startup;
 on mismatch we get ONE os.dup(reserve) rebuild budget; stale wrappers are
 destroyed only if provably still ours (ino match), else PARKED.

Protocol (JSON-per-line):
 protocol IN (host -> worker): execute requests AND host_response frames
 protocol OUT (worker -> host): host_call / stdout_chunk / final response frames

#: Derived, not chosen. It was a flat 8_000_000 with a comment claiming it sat
#: "above the largest legitimate frame (a response carries stdout and stderr,
#: each capped at MAX_OUTPUT)" -- true only for ASCII. MAX_OUTPUT counts
#: CHARACTERS and this counts BYTES, and one character is up to 4 bytes in
#: UTF-8 and up to 6 in JSON's `\uXXXX` escape. Measured: both streams filled
#: to the cap with CJK text, or with control characters, serialise to
#: 12,000,059 bytes -- so a cell whose output obeyed every documented limit had
#: its whole frame replaced by a drop note, taking stderr, the exception text,
#: `error_lineno`, `guards` and `usage` with it. Only stdout survived, and only
#: because the manager backfills it from the streamed chunks.
#:
#: Twelve, not six. `\uXXXX` is six bytes and that is what a CJK character or a
#: control character costs -- but Python counts an astral character (an emoji,
#: say) as ONE character while JSON must emit it as a surrogate pair,
#: `\ud83d\ude00`, which is twelve. Six was the first value here and the test
#: below caught it: `MAX_OUTPUT` characters of emoji is 12 MB per stream, and a
#: cap derived from six would have gone on dropping exactly the frames this
#: change exists to stop dropping.
#:
#: It still bounds the allocation the backstop is for: a
#: `print("x" * 200_000_000)` is stopped just the same.
#: One spelling of the marker, so the streamed tail and the captured result
#: cannot disagree about what happened.
