"""First-class persistent R kernel — the R sibling of the python worker.

The host executes exactly two kinds of instructions: python cells on the
Jupyter-style worker (kernel/worker.py) and R cells on kernel/r_worker.R. Both
speak the same JSON-per-line frame protocol and are driven by the SAME manager
(kernel/manager.Kernel) — this module only resolves an R interpreter and builds
the argv that gives r_worker.R the fd discipline worker.py gets from its dup2
swap:

    sh -c 'exec "$0" --vanilla "$1" 3>&1 4<&0 </dev/null 1>&2' <Rscript> <r_worker.R>

- protocol OUT rides fd 3 (aliased from the stdout pipe the manager reads),
- protocol IN rides fd 4 (aliased from the stdin pipe the manager writes),
- fd 0 becomes /dev/null so R code reading stdin cannot eat protocol frames,
- fd 1 is aliased to stderr so stray C-level prints never corrupt the wire,
- `exec` keeps the shell child's pid == R's pid, so Kernel.interrupt()'s SIGINT
  lands in R directly (including when bubblewrap supervises that child) and is
  caught there as an interrupt condition with `interrupted=True`. R only
  installs that handler when the disposition it inherits is not SIG_IGN, and a
  backgrounded daemon (`./start.sh &`, nohup) passes SIG_IGN through every
  exec in this chain — kernel/transport.py's spawn boundary resets SIGINT to
  SIG_DFL in the child so the guarantee holds regardless of launch mode (the
  reset cannot live in _SH_WRAP: POSIX forbids a non-interactive shell from
  resetting a signal ignored on entry, so `trap - INT` would be a no-op).

The R kernel is an ANALYSIS kernel: it never emits host_call frames and has no
`host` object — completion (host.submit_output) stays on the python control
plane. Pure stdlib.
