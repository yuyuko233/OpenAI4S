"""Built-in runnable environments — the prebuilt (conda) envs the host ships with.

Instead of pip-installing a scientific stack into ONE kernel on every task, the
session kernel can run in any of several **prebuilt environments**, each already
stocked for a domain (general data-science, structural biology, phylogenetics,
R). The agent (or the user, from the Notebook env selector) simply *picks* the
environment that already has what the task needs — `host.env.use("struct")` —
instead of installing packages every time.

Discovery is cheap-ish and cached module-wide:
  - `bin/python` / `bin/Rscript` probe → language + interpreter path;
  - `pkgscan.collect_packages` → the env's installed package set (lazy, cached
    per Environment);
  - a curated description derived from a handful of notable packages.

Discovery roots, in priority order:
  1. ``OPENAI4S_ENV_ROOTS`` — ``:``-separated *envs* directories (override);
  2. Conda/Mamba's own environment-root variables and active prefix;
  3. the base interpreter behind the daemon's venv;
  4. the usual conda/mamba install locations under ``$HOME``.

A synthetic ``base`` environment (the daemon's own interpreter, ``sys.executable``,
carrying the preinstalled stack from :mod:`openai4s.kernel.preinstall`) is
always present so env selection never leaves the user without a Python kernel.

Pure stdlib (+ :mod:`openai4s.pkgscan`), so it imports under any of the
prebuilt interpreters as well as the control kernel.
