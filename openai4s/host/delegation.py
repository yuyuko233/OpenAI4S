    Two different merges, because two of these fields are restrictions and the

    A setting the caller named wins; the row is only a default. That is what
    `if target not in merged` implements and it is right for model, provider,
    steps and permissions.

    A *restriction* must not work that way, and it did. `skill_names`,
    `connectors` and `unrestricted` all took the call-site value verbatim
    whenever the call named one, so the stored row was advisory: measured
    against a row of `{skill_names: ["only-this"], connectors: [],
    unrestricted: False}`, a call naming three skills got three, a call naming a
    connector got it despite `[]` meaning *denied*, and a call passing
    `unrestricted=True` got it. Both are reachable through the documented
    `host.delegate(...)` signature and the `delegate_task` tool schema, so the
    agent chose its own allowlist and the exit criterion -- "a child may only
    narrow" -- was inverted.

    `resource_allowlist.narrow` is the intersection this needed and it already
    existed; its own docstring warns that treating the child's value as the
    answer "would hand a restricted parent's delegate an unrestricted set, and
    delegation would become the way out of every restriction". Nothing called
    it here. `SkillService.set_allowed_skills` does narrow correctly -- it was
    being handed a value that had already been widened.
