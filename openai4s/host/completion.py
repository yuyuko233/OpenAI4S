# files the run never produced, or a summary whose numbers contradict the same
# submission's own metrics.  Accepting that publishes provenance that is wrong
# rather than absent, so claims are checked per-item against the run's
# evidence and refused as a repairable soft error.

#: ``output`` keys whose string values assert a produced file.  Deliberately
#: produce-shaped: input-shaped keys (``source``, ``input``, ``path``,
#: ``data``) stay out so naming what a cell merely *read* is never flagged.
