"""Completion evidence for turns whose deliverable is source code.

The existing reconciliation is produce-file shaped: it asks whether a claimed
file exists. That is the right question for a figure and the wrong one for a
pipeline — a `.py` path that exists proves nothing about whether the module
imports, whether it was ever captured, or whether any test ran against it.

For ``reusable_pipeline`` and ``codebase_change`` (see
:mod:`openai4s.agent.task_modes`) the completion payload must therefore carry
four fields, and each is verified against something the run cannot author.
The owning loops stamp the dispatcher's binding mode only when the mode was
selected EXPLICITLY (the Web ``task_mode`` body field, ``openai4s run
--mode``); a mode merely detected from the request text drives the prompt
fragment and never reaches this module, so a classifier false positive cannot
refuse an honest completion. Fields volunteered on an unarmed turn ride the
completion envelope as ordinary, unverified output. The four fields, and what
each is verified against:

``source_files``
    Every file resolves inside the session workspace, passes the same
    secret/alias-aware read boundary as the Host file tools, matches its
    declared sha256, and matches the checksum of an artifact version at that
    exact workspace-relative path in the current session root. A basename (or
    same-project artifact from another session) is not evidence for a path.
``entry_points``
    Each file exists; a Python entry point must ``compile()`` from its own
    source bytes. **Compile only, never exec** — validating an entry point must
    not be a way to run arbitrary code inside the daemon process. Non-Python
    entries (``.R``/``.r`` and anything else) are existence-checked only,
    because the daemon has no honest way to parse them.
``architecture_summary``
    A non-empty prose statement of what each module owns.
``test_evidence``
    Each entry names a command and the ``producing_cell_id`` of the cell that
    ran it. The cell must be a real successful execution in the current
    user-turn/branch, and its action group must contain a successful synthetic
    ``bash`` audit receipt for the exact Host-authorized command digest. Merely
    printing passing-looking text, citing a different command, or replaying a
    prior turn's Cell cannot satisfy the contract.

``analysis_run`` is untouched: the fields stay optional and unvalidated, so
every existing completion keeps working byte for byte.

    ``search_roots`` normally contains exactly the session workspace.
    ``source_reader`` is the Host file service's verified opener projected as a
    bounded bytes reader, so evidence cannot become a second route around its
    secret-name, alias, hardlink, and descriptor checks. ``artifact_checksums``
    maps exact normalized workspace-relative paths to current-root artifact
    checksums. ``cell_lookup`` reads one ``execution_log`` row by producing
    cell id, and ``frame_id`` scopes it: a real row from someone else's session
    is not this run's evidence. ``test_receipt`` proves that the same Cell's
    action group in the bound turn/branch recorded a successful Host-authorized
    execution of the exact command.

    ``has_cells`` is a lazy probe — "did this runtime record ANY cell for this
    run?" — consulted only when a named cell is missing, so the refusal can
    honestly distinguish "this run never executed that cell" from "this
    runtime records no cells at all". ``None`` means unknown and keeps the
