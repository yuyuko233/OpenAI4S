    """The one team-mode visibility rule, as SQL over a frames-shaped table.

    Returns `(clause, params)` for a WHERE conjunct. One function because
    `browse`, `search` and `frame_detail` must answer the same question:
    three spellings of a visibility rule is three chances for one of them
    to be wrong, and the two that had no rule at all were reachable from
    `host.frames` with a colleague's frame id.

    Three properties worth stating, because each was a defect:

    **Scoped by the root session, not the frame.** Ownership is recorded
    per session in `session_owners`; a child frame has no row of its own.
    Matching on `frame_id` therefore hid every child frame from its own
    owner while `frame_detail` — which takes any frame id — had no rule at
    all. `COALESCE(root_frame_id, frame_id)` is the session a row belongs
    to.

    **A global guest never widens.** `session_visible_to` returns False for
    any account whose *global* role is guest, before it consults
    `project_members`. This clause omitted that, so an admin adding a guest
    to a project with the default `member` row listed them every
    project-visibility session — which they were then 404'd from opening.
    A listing that names sessions the caller cannot open is the leak INV-13
    describes, not a cosmetic inconsistency.

    **A session with no owner row is admin-only.** Pre-team history and
    demo seeds have none, and "we do not know whose this is" must not
    resolve to "everyone's".

    Filtered in SQL rather than after the read: keyset pagination reports
    `has_more` from row counts, so a post-read filter turns a full page of
    hidden rows into a phantom end-of-list — and for `search` and
    `frame_detail` the rows carry cell code and stdout, which a post-read
    filter would have already loaded.

    **A delegate-frame key resolves through the frames table.** A delegated
    child's rows are keyed under the child's own delegate frame
    (`frame_id = root_frame_id = <child frame id>`), which never has a
    `session_owners` row — resolving the raw key against `session_owners`
    made every child-keyed row admin-only, invisible to the very owner whose
    session spawned it. The frames table stores each frame's fully-resolved
    session root, so one lookup maps a delegate-frame key to the parent
    session; a key with no frames-table entry keeps the raw-key rule above.
    """
    # `session_expr` for a table that is not frames-shaped: `artifacts` has a
    # `root_frame_id` and no `frame_id`, and the ⌘K search needs the same rule
    # over it. Defaulted rather than required, so every existing caller keeps
    # the frames spelling.

        repeat rows whenever a frame is created or deleted between pages, which
        for a session list is routine rather than exotic.

        The ``frame_id`` tiebreaker is what makes the cursor sound at all:

        the same millisecond are not rare (a script, a test, a fast fork). With
