"""Artifact, version, environment, and lineage persistence.

The repository shares its owning ``Store`` connection and re-entrant lock.  A
few callbacks are deliberately late-bound by the Store facade: the legacy
methods called ``self.get_artifact()``, ``self.get_frame()``, ``self._exec()``,
and related helpers dynamically, so wiring lambdas preserves monkeypatch and
subclass behavior instead of freezing bound methods during construction.

        A version is a byte identity, while an observation is a producer
        identity.  With ``reuse_matching_head`` enabled, the current head may
        therefore be reused when a new Cell producer and an equal checksum are
        explicit.  The current head may have originated outside a Cell (for
        example, an upload or a native writing tool); its absent producer stays
        absent while the new Cell gets a durable observation.  We never search
        historical versions for this optimization and never rewrite the reused
        version's original provenance.  The default keeps the pre-rollout
        versioning behavior, including its return shape and lack of observation

        another session's file in place. A cross-session read leaves the
        borrowing session with an analysis whose input has no version in its own
        history: delete or revert the other session and the provenance of this

        "where did this come from" keeps an answer that does not depend on the
        other session still existing.

        Scope is enforced here rather than by the caller. Same project only, and
        a source in another project raises the same `KeyError` as a source that
        does not exist -- a distinct "forbidden" would confirm the object is
        there, which is the one bit a caller outside the project should not be
        able to read.

        Byte movement is owned by the caller's durable publish callback. It
        writes the exact upload journal before changing either final pathname;
        this transaction commits only after publication succeeds, and startup
        recovery can therefore distinguish an interrupted commit from a

        filesystem path rather than an id, and the identity fallback below scans
        *every* row in the database. An agent could hand it any absolute path
        and learn whether another project held a version for it -- and the id it
        got back then passed unvalidated into `prov_record`, whose lineage read
        returns the input version's filename and path. An existence oracle that
        escalates to disclosure.

        The predicates go into both SELECTs rather than filtering afterwards.
        Post-filtering is wrong and not merely slower: this returns one best
        candidate, so discarding a foreign winner would answer None even when an
        in-scope version for the same path exists further down the list.
