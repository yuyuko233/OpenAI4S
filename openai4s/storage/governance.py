"""Team-mode governance storage: membership, invites, usage, quotas (M2).

Four tables, all additive (INV-1), all behind the same numbered-migration
discipline as storage/team.py:

  project_members  who belongs to which project, with a per-project role.
                   Admins are implicit members of everything and have no
                   rows here; a row's role is 'member' or 'guest'.
  invites          project-scoped, expiring guest invitations. Only
                   ``sha256(token)`` is stored — the raw invite token is
                   printed once by whoever created it (D4-adjacent hygiene:
                   a database read must not mint a working invite).
  usage_ledger     append-only metering rows (M2-5): LLM tokens and kernel
                   CPU seconds, attributed ``(user, project, kind, amount,
                   ref)``. Aggregation happens in SQL here, not in callers.
  quotas           per-user/per-project limits by kind and window (M2-6).
                   The *check* lives here beside the ledger it reads;
                   callers get a verdict, never raw rows.

All four are agent-invisible through ``host.query`` (QUERY_DENYLIST):
invites hold credential digests, and the rest is governance state.
