"""Durable workloads and allocations — the reconciler's WorkloadStore (M3a-8).

Two tables from the plan's appendix A, and one index that is the whole of
INV-3:

    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ux_active_allocation ON allocations(workload_id)
      WHERE phase IN (...)

That partial index is the enforcement, not the Python check beside it. The
check exists to give a readable error; the index exists because the failure
it prevents happens *between* a check and an insert — a reconciler tick that
dies right there, restarts, and submits a second job holding a second GPU.
One of those two is a race the other cannot have.

`submission_token` is UNIQUE for the same reason: INV-8's reconciliation
asks "does anything carry this token", and an answer is only meaningful if
the token could never have been minted twice.

Rows are converted to and from the orchestration dataclasses here, so the
reconciler never sees a database row and this module never sees a backend.
