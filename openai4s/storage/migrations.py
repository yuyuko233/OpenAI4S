"""Versioned, transactional schema migrations for the Store's SQLite database.

Before this, the database carried no version marker at all. Every open re-probed
every table with ``PRAGMA table_info`` and issued ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`` for
whatever was absent, with a bare ``except sqlite3.OperationalError: pass`` around
each one. Three problems follow from that, in increasing order of seriousness:

  * the shape had to be rediscovered on every open, so "is this database current"
    was not a question the code could answer;
  * the swallow made a genuinely failed ALTER indistinguishable from the benign
    "duplicate column name" of a re-run, so the process continued against a
    schema missing a column it believed it had; and
  * the set was not atomic. The ALTERs ran outside any transaction, so an
    upgrade that failed part-way left a partially-migrated schema — with no
    version marker to detect it by.

## Retrofitting a version onto an unversioned database

An existing install has an unknown subset of the legacy ALTERs applied, and no
record of which. That history cannot be reconstructed — but it does not need to
be. The legacy pass is *idempotent by predicate*: it adds only columns that are
absent, and every backfill is guarded by a WHERE clause that selects only rows
that still need it (``WHERE code_hash IS NULL``, ``WHERE branch_id IS NULL``…).
Running it once more on any database, old or new, converges to the same shape.

So version 1 is defined as "the legacy baseline has been run to completion", and
is stamped after it succeeds. From version 2 on, migrations are numbered, run
exactly once, and are recorded with a checksum.

## Transactions

SQLite supports transactional DDL: inside an explicit transaction, a rolled-back
``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`` really does un-add its column. So the whole set rides
one explicit BEGIN/COMMIT issued here.

The explicit BEGIN is the load-bearing part, and it is worth being precise about
why, because the folklore says otherwise. Old pysqlite implicitly committed
before DDL, which would have silently defeated this — but that behaviour was
removed in Python 3.6, long before this project's 3.10 floor. What *does* still
bite is DDL outside any transaction: with the default ``isolation_level``,
pysqlite opens a transaction before DML but not before DDL, so a bare ALTER runs
in autocommit and survives a subsequent ROLLBACK. Hence: open the transaction
explicitly, and never let a step commit inside it.

The invariant this buys: a database is either fully at version N or still fully
at version N-1. There is no in-between state to recognise, which is what makes
an interrupted upgrade recoverable by simply running again.
