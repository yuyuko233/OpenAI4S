"""One spelling for an LLM endpoint, and one place that strips its secrets.

Two questions were being answered by three private helpers, none of which the
profile writer could reach:

* *Is this the same endpoint?* `capabilities._normalize_endpoint` trims a
  trailing slash so a capability lookup is stable. Profiles compared the raw
  strings, so `https://h/v1` and `https://h/v1/` were two revisions of one
  configuration.
* *May this string be shown?* `doctor._sanitize_endpoint` drops userinfo and
  query -- its docstring says so in as many words -- and it had exactly one call
  site, in the diagnostics report. A profile's `base_url` was stored verbatim,
  published verbatim by `GET /model-profiles`, and frozen verbatim into an
  immutable revision. Measured: `https://user:s3cr3t@api.internal.corp/v1?key=abc`
  came back from the public projection with the password in it, and the sealed
  revision kept it forever.

That is plan section 7.2's "secrets do not enter the snapshot" being violated
through the endpoint field rather than the key field. The API key goes through
the secret broker; the credentials someone puts in a URL went nowhere near it.

So the stored form is the normalised, credential-free one. Nothing is redacted
at display time, because a value that was never stored cannot leak from a
surface nobody remembered to redact.
