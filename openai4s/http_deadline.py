"""Absolute wall-clock deadlines for pure-stdlib HTTP exchanges.

``urllib`` passes its ``timeout`` to a socket as an *idle* timeout.  That
bounds a silent peer, but a peer that drips one response-header byte before
each idle timeout can keep ``opener.open()`` inside ``HTTPResponse.begin()``
forever.  This module adds the missing wall-clock boundary without moving the
request or its credentials to a worker thread.

The watchdog knows only the active socket.  It never retains a Request,
headers, body, URL, or credential.  On expiry it shuts down and closes that
socket, unblocking connect, proxy CONNECT, TLS handshake, status/header reads,
or body reads.  DNS resolution is the one deliberate stdlib limitation:
``socket.getaddrinfo`` exposes neither a cancellation handle nor a portable
timeout.  The watchdog records expiry during DNS and refuses to connect once
resolution returns, but cannot make a stuck system resolver return sooner.

    property below had to be discovered once and then written into each copy by
    hand:

    * ``read1`` over ``read``.  ``BufferedReader.read(n)`` may issue many recv
      calls while trying to fill ``n``, so a peer dripping one byte before each
      idle timeout keeps a *single* call alive forever.  ``read1`` performs at
      most one raw read, so the absolute budget and the socket bound are
      recomputed for every chunk.
    * Stop at end-of-body, tested at the top of the loop.  ``http.client``
      retires the transport on the same read that returns the final content
      byte of a known ``Content-Length`` (CPython 3.11+; the 3.10 floor waits
      one read longer), so proving it with one more read asked a closed socket
      to bound a read that cannot happen and reported a complete response as
      ``OSError``.  Testing before the arming is what makes that unreachable,
      rather than something a tolerant ``settimeout`` has to absorb.  Chunked
      and close-delimited bodies retire on a read that returns ``b""`` and need
      no branch of their own.
    * An empty read is not proof of a complete body.  If the reader is still
      owed bytes, the peer cut the connection, and that is a transport failure
      -- not the invalid-JSON the caller would otherwise diagnose.
    * The exchange owns timeout classification as well as the clock.  Its
      watchdog can close the body socket between a positive budget check and
      either ``settimeout`` or ``read1``; those operations can then report
      ``OSError``, ``IncompleteRead``, or an empty chunk.  Only failures that
      coincide with an actual watchdog expiry become ``on_timeout``.  A merely
      late clock still cannot invalidate a body already known to be complete.
    * ``on_unbounded`` makes a missing read bound fatal.  Pass ``None`` only
