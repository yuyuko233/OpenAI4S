"""Operating-system sandbox adapter for scientific kernel subprocesses.

The application-level safety classifier and path checks are useful policy
layers, but they are not a process isolation boundary.  This module adds that
boundary at the one place where a Python/R worker is created:

* macOS uses ``sandbox-exec`` (Seatbelt),
* Linux uses ``bwrap`` (bubblewrap),
* other platforms report an explicit unsupported status.

The default policy is intentionally small and auditable.  The worker may read
the host filesystem (its interpreter and scientific packages live there), but
may write only its session workspace and a newly-created private temporary
directory.  Raw network access is denied; Host RPC web tools run in the daemon
and therefore remain available.  ``OPENAI4S_KERNEL_ALLOW_RAW_NETWORK=1`` is a
trusted, host-global compatibility escape hatch.

``OPENAI4S_KERNEL_SANDBOX`` accepts:

``auto`` (default)
    Enforce a sandbox after detection and a real startup self-test.  If the OS
    facility is missing or unusable, continue unsandboxed with a high-visibility
    warning and a machine-readable degraded status.
``enforce``
    The same detection and self-test, but fail closed before a worker starts.
``off``
    Explicitly disable the OS boundary.  This is visible in status and never
    happens implicitly.

The adapter is pure stdlib.  Detection and command execution are injectable so
the supported paths can be tested even inside a parent sandbox that forbids
nested sandbox creation.
