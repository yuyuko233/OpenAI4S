"""One command that answers "is this installation able to do the work?"

Every probe here already existed, each behind a separate HTTP route or import,
which meant the person best placed to need them — someone whose daemon will not
start, or whose first run failed — had no single thing to run and nothing
coherent to paste into a report.

Three properties make it useful rather than decorative:

* **It runs without the daemon.** A check that needs the server is unavailable
  in exactly the situation that motivates running it. Everything below reads
  config, the filesystem, and the store directly.
* **It never fails the process on a warning.** `warn` means degraded but
  usable; only `fail` means the work cannot proceed. Conflating them would
  train people to ignore the output.
* **It reports no secret values.** Whether a credential is configured is a
  diagnostic; the credential is not. The same rule the diagnostics bundle and
  the connector API already follow.
