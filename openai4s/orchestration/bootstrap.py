"""Bootstrap credentials for a worker that dials in (plan M3b-2).

A worker placed by a scheduler has to prove, over a socket the daemon did
not initiate, that it is the worker this daemon asked for. The credential
that proves it is an HMAC over the facts that make it *this* attempt:

    (allocation_id, epoch, rank, expires_at, nonce)

signed with a per-daemon secret that never leaves the machine. Each field
is there because leaving it out permits something:

* ``allocation_id`` — without it a credential is transferable between jobs.
* ``epoch`` — without it a credential from a *previous* incarnation still
  works, and INV-7's whole point is that an old epoch is refused.
* ``rank`` — a multi-node allocation has several workers and they are not
  interchangeable; M4's gang readiness counts them.
* ``expires_at`` — a queued job may sit for hours, but a credential that
  never expires is a credential that leaks eventually.
* ``nonce`` — consumed at registration, so a captured credential cannot be
  replayed by a second connection.

**The credential travels as a file, never as an environment variable.** The
file is 0600 in the session's runtime directory and the scheduler is given
only its *path* — which is why `SlurmBroker` refuses credential-shaped
environment names outright. A job's environment is visible to anyone who
can read `/proc/<pid>/environ` or `scontrol show job`; a 0600 file is
visible to the user who owns it.

Verification is constant-time and, on success, single-use: `consume`
records the nonce, and a second presentation of the same credential is
refused even though its signature is still perfectly valid.
