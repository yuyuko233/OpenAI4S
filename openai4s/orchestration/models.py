"""Provider-neutral values for the cluster control plane (plan M3a-1).

This module is the *orchestration* vocabulary: what work was asked for
(``Workload``), what resource was granted for one attempt at it
(``Allocation``), what shape that resource has (``ResourceProfile``), and why
something ended (``Reason``). It deliberately knows nothing about how any of
it is realised — no scheduler, no ssh, no submission command — because INV-2
makes that ignorance checkable: `tests/test_orchestration_backend_opacity.py`
asserts this module's source and import graph never name a scheduler. That
check is literal, and deliberately so: if "explanatory" mentions were
allowed, every leak would arrive as an explanatory mention. So the words
belong in a backend subpackage and in cluster.toml, including here in prose.

Terminology, fixed by the plan's §2 so two vocabularies cannot drift:

* the kernel layer's ``generation`` is this layer's **execution_epoch** —
  the same idea (a monotonically increasing incarnation counter whose old
  values must be refused, INV-7), named per layer;
* the spec's "declarative configuration version" is **spec_revision** here,
  never "generation", because that word is already spoken for.

Two shapes carry the invariants that are easy to lose:

``ExternalHandle`` keeps a backend's own identifier (a scheduler's job id, a
local pid) *wrapped*. INV-2 says the API exposes ``allocation_id`` and
nothing else; a bare string would have leaked through a dozen call sites by
the second week.

``SubmissionToken`` is minted and persisted *before* a submission is
attempted, which is what makes INV-8 expressible at all: after a lost
response, "did my submission land?" is a question about a token the backend
was told to record, not about a job id that may not have reached us.
