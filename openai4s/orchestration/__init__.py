"""Cluster control plane: workloads, allocations, and the backend boundary.

Deliberately importable without importing any backend. `models` and `ports`
are the contract; a scheduler-specific implementation lives in its own
subpackage and is imported by composition code, never from here — which is
what lets the INV-2 leak guard assert that this package's import graph
cannot reach a scheduler.
