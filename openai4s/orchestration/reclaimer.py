"""Leases that lapse, so an idle session stops holding a GPU (M3b-4).

The reclaimer states an intent and stops: an expired lease becomes
`request_stop(reason=...)`, and the reconciler's cancel barrier does the
actual releasing. That split is not ceremony. The barrier has a fixed
order, is re-entrant, and is the single place a resource is given back; a
reclaimer that called the backend itself would be a second, subtly
different teardown path — and the two would drift on exactly the failure
where it matters.

**A worker being alive is not a user being present.** This is the whole
subtlety of the feature, and it is easy to get backwards. A cluster
session whose process is healthy, whose socket is connected and whose
heartbeats arrive on schedule is still idle if nobody has run anything in
it — and it is still holding the resource somebody else is queued for. So
this loop reads `last_active_at` and never writes it, and nothing in the
transport or the watchdog writes it either. Only a user executing
something, or explicitly asking to keep the session, does.

Which clock ran out decides the reason code, and the reason code is what
the user reads afterwards: `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT` means "come back and it
will be here again", `SESSION_MAX_LIFETIME_EXCEEDED` means "this one is
over regardless of what you do". Reporting the first when it was the
second sends a user to retry a thing that cannot work.
