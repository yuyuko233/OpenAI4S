"""The reconciler: desired state in, backend calls out (M3a-6).

One periodic, single-threaded pass compares what each workload *wants*
against what its backend *reports*, and takes at most one step per workload
per tick. Deliberately not event-driven: a resource plane's truth is
whatever it says when asked, and a system that only reacts to events is a
system that believes its own last message after the cluster stopped agreeing
with it.

Everything here is written to be run twice. A tick that crashes half way
through must be safe to repeat, because that is the only failure mode a
daemon actually has — so every step is expressed as "given this observation,
what is the next durable fact", never as "continue what I was doing".

Three rules the plan pins, implemented as code rather than as comments:

**INV-8, submission reconciliation.** An `Unknown` result never becomes a
retry. It is recorded, and the *next* tick asks the backend whether anything
carries the token before deciding anything. `find_by_token` answering yes
adopts that handle; answering no is what makes a fresh submission safe.

**INV-3, one active allocation.** A workload gets a new allocation only when
it has no live one. The store's partial unique index is the real enforcement
(a crash between check and insert is exactly when a second one would appear);
this is the readable half.

**The cancel barrier, in the plan's fixed order.** fence new work → cancel
active tasks → drain → cancel the backend allocation → observe terminal →
mark terminal. Written as one method so the order is a thing you can read,
rather than an ordering that emerges from where the calls happen to sit.
