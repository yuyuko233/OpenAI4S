"""SlurmBroker: every sbatch/squeue/sacct/scancel call, and all the parsing.

One module owns the subprocess boundary so two properties can be checked in
one place rather than argued about at a dozen call sites:

**Arguments are constructed, never concatenated (INV-9).** Every value that
reaches argv is either a literal this module wrote or a typed field that was
validated on the way in. There is no shell: `subprocess.run` gets a list,
`shell=False`, so a profile named ``gpu; rm -rf /`` is an argument, not a
command. Job names and comments are additionally restricted to a character
class, because they are the two fields that carry our own identifiers into
the scheduler's output and back out through a parser.

**Secrets never reach the scheduler (INV-9).** A comment carries the
submission token — an opaque, single-purpose id that is useless without our
database — and never a credential. The bootstrap secret of M3b travels as a
*path* to an 0600 file, which is why the environment allowlist below refuses
anything that looks like a credential rather than trusting the caller.

Parsing lives here and only here. `--parsable` and `--noheader --format` are
requested everywhere they exist so the output shape is ours to pin, and
every parser tolerates the fields it does not know: a scheduler upgrade that
adds a column must not turn into a crash in a daemon.
