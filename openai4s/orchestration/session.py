"""A chat session whose kernel lives on a granted resource (M3b-3/5).

Two ideas carry this module, and both are invariants rather than design
preferences.

**INV-5 — readiness is a conjunction.** A session is running only when all
four of these hold: the allocation is granted, the worker has registered,
the workspace exists, and the kernel answers. The resource plane saying
"running" means a process was started somewhere; it says nothing about
whether that process reached us, whether its files are where the user's
data is, or whether it can evaluate `1+1`. Reporting ready on the
scheduler's word alone is the specific failure this shape exists to
prevent: a user typing into a session that cannot execute, and a support
conversation that begins "but the cluster says it's running".
`SessionReadiness` therefore has no boolean shortcut — it names which
condition is missing, because "not ready" without "waiting for the worker
to dial in" is a spinner with no information in it.

**INV-9 — the credential is per attempt, and never persisted.** The user's
`WorkloadSpec` is durable and is what an operator can read back. The spec
that is actually submitted is derived from it at submission time, once per
attempt, and carries a freshly minted credential written to a 0600 file
whose *path* is all the resource plane is told. Persisting it would put a
signature into `spec_json`, where every later reader of the workloads
table would inherit it; deriving it per attempt is also what makes a
recovery a genuinely new attempt (INV-7) rather than a replay of the old
one's identity.

**The file mode is not the isolation boundary.** Interactive placement is
accepted only when the selected backend promises a verified per-allocation OS
identity or mount boundary.  A 0600 credential is readable by every process
with its owning uid, so a same-identity sibling could otherwise register first
and receive the victim's Cell and Host-RPC traffic.  This check happens both
before durable session creation and before an attempt credential is minted.

Nothing here names a scheduler (INV-2): a "worker launch" is a command and
an environment, and which resource plane runs it is the backend's business.
