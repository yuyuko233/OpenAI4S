# Worker-side Host SDK

[中文说明](README_zh.md)

This is the `host` object that agent code touches inside a Python Cell, and the worker's half of the inner loop. [`worker.py`](../kernel/worker.py) calls `build_host(host_call, ...)` and injects the returned singleton as `host`. Most methods are thin and synchronous: encode the public Python arguments, send one `host_call` to the daemon, block until the matching `host_response` comes back, decode it, and either return the value or raise on a soft error.

## Where this fits

The SDK is not the authorization boundary, and it normally does not implement capability behavior at all. Validation, permissions, approvals, auditing, screening and the real work belong to [`HostDispatcher`](../host_dispatch.py) and the services under [`openai4s/host`](../host). Two pieces genuinely run in the worker, and both matter:

- `host.bash(...)` runs the subprocess inside the scientific worker, and only after the host has issued an exact, one-shot capability and atomically consumed it. Whether that worker is confined by the OS is a separate question: it depends on the sandbox mode and on whether confinement was actually established. The default mode is `auto`, which stays up and reports `state="unavailable"` when detection or the self-test fails, so the subprocess may well run unconfined.
- `host.compute` builds its Python handle objects locally. Provider discovery, job submission, status, cancellation and harvesting are all host calls.

The R analysis worker never imports this package and has no `host` singleton.

## Files

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`__init__.py`](__init__.py) | Exports `build_host`, the composition entry point the Python worker calls. |
| [`bash.py`](bash.py) | Runs shell commands in the worker, and only under an authorization it cannot grant itself. It proposes an exact command, cwd, kernel generation and challenge, then checks every binding on the capability that comes back and spends the token once. Around the run it snapshots bounded workspace file metadata. Both streams are drained as the command produces them and only their tails retained — `capture_output=True` held all of both in worker memory before the cap ever ran, so the budget described what the caller was shown rather than what was allocated — and the deadline is enforced on the process *group*, because `subprocess.run(timeout=)` kills the shell alone: `bash -c "python train.py"` returned `completed` with rc 0 while the python it had started carried on running. The bounded result and the file diff go back to the host with secret-looking paths masked, and each stream carries `seen`/`retained`/`dropped`/`truncated`, so a command that printed five million characters is not recorded as one that printed exactly thirty thousand. |
| [`compute.py`](compute.py) | Backs the `host.compute` namespace and the local instance and job handles. It normalizes provider parameters and paths, maps each operation onto a `compute_<op>` RPC, and offers submit/status/result/cancel/download/upload/close/attach plus `reconcile` and `job_history` on top. No provider transport lives here. Nothing runs in the background on the caller's behalf: `.result()` is the call that probes the remote and harvests it, so a job nobody polls is never harvested and keeps billing until it is cancelled. `submit_job` takes an `idempotency_key` because without one there is no basis on which to tell a retry from a new job, and the retry becomes a second remote run. The terminal-state vocabulary is imported from [`compute/states.py`](../compute/states.py) rather than restated — the local copy tested against two statuses the host has never produced, so any unrecognized live state was cached as final. |
| [`host.py`](host.py) | The public `host.*` facade. A strict wire codec sits at the top and maps snake_case against camelCase. Under it: the skills/query/lineage/endpoints/credentials/MCP/environments/science/compute namespaces, the file, network, delegation and session helpers, and `host.submit_output`. `materialise_artifact` brings another session's version in as *this* session's Artifact with a lineage edge back to where it came from, so an analysis keeps a resolvable provenance even after the source session is deleted; `save_artifact(source=...)` carries the retrieval envelope that separates a saved file from evidence. The network helpers grew HEAD probes, a `user_agent` override and `web_download` because the Skills that needed any of the three reached for raw `urllib` instead — a request subject to neither the egress allowlist nor the SSRF guard. `web_search` answers through Doubao when an Agent Plan key is configured and through the fallback engines otherwise, and reports which in `source`. The model-backend bring-up surface adds `accelerator_status`, which reports local GPUs and SSH-remote GPU registrations separately — hardware visibility does not imply that a repository, environment, checkpoint or canary has been admitted — and `stage_model_asset`, which imports a user-supplied local checkpoint without admitting it. |

## RPC and completion contract

- Every call blocks inside the Python Cell. The worker's Host-call transaction lock allows only one request in flight, even if user code spins up threads.
- An optional field whose value is `None` is omitted from the wire rather than sent as JSON `null`. The strict Host schema distinguishes an absent field from an invalid null one, and rejects the null.
- A host soft-error object arrives back as a `RuntimeError`. Provider and compute errors may carry a structured error kind or concurrency detail, but they are still failures.
- `host.submit_output(...)` is the only SDK method that can mark a Python Cell as successfully complete. Printing, returning a Python value, producing an R result, or making an ordinary Host call that merely succeeds does not end the outer agent run.

## Security and failure boundaries

- The SDK is trusted code inside an already powerful Python process. Its argument checks help protocol integrity; they do not replace dispatcher permissions or the OS sandbox.
- Shell authorization binds the token to the command digest, canonical cwd, workspace root, worker generation, challenge and expiry. Worker validation and host consumption both fail closed, and a daemon restart invalidates every capability still outstanding in memory. A local worker reads its authorization generation from its environment; a remote worker has no such environment and receives it on the handshake response, passed into `build_host(generation=...)` at construction — the executor reads its fallback once, so a value supplied later would arrive too late.
- Redaction of shell stdout/stderr is defensive and shape-based. It cannot guarantee that a deliberately transformed or simply unrecognized secret stays out of the output.
- Compute handles are convenience projections, not durable Python objects. After a Cell or kernel restart you have to rebuild the handle or attach by job ID. The remote job is what outlives all of it, which is why `host.compute.reconcile()` exists to name the jobs that were still live when the daemon last stopped — and why it resubmits none of them: a recovered job may or may not still be running, and guessing wrong costs either a duplicate charge or a lost result.
- `host.compute` is an evolving integration surface. The existence of a public SDK method does not by itself guarantee a configured provider, working confinement, remote capacity, a successful harvest, or a second approval for every follow-up operation.
