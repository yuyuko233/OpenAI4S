## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: MS-DIAL 5.x (LC-MS) / MS-DIAL 4.x (GC-MS), pandas 2.2+, R 4.3+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- CLI: run `MsdialConsoleApp` with no arguments to print the current subcommand/flag list
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters
- Python: `pip show pandas` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

The MS-DIAL GUI runs only on Windows; the console (MsdialConsoleApp) is the cross-platform headless entry. Which build supports a task is itself a constraint: MS-DIAL 5-alpha covers DI-MS, IM-MS, LC-MS, LC-IM-MS but NOT GC-MS - GC-EI stays in the MS-DIAL 4 lineage. If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed package and adapt rather than retrying.

# MS-DIAL Preprocessing

**"Process my LC-MS run with MS-DIAL and give me a feature table"** -> Pick peaks per file, deconvolve chimeric MS/MS into clean component spectra (MS2Dec), align across samples, gap-fill, then import the alignment result and filter it honestly.
- CLI: `MsdialConsoleApp lcmsdda|lcmsdia|gcms -i <in> -o <out> -m <param.txt>`
- R: `read.csv(..., skip = 4, check.names = FALSE)` to parse the alignment export
- Python: `pandas.read_csv(..., skiprows=4)` for the same export

## The Single Most Important Insight -- Preprocessing Software Is Not Neutral

The same raw files through MS-DIAL versus XCMS yield different feature tables and different marker lists. Li 2018 benchmarked five tools on a 1,100-compound standard and found that while feature *detection* was broadly similar, *quantification* and the set of selected discriminating markers differed by tool. A metabolomics "hit" is conditional on (raw data + software + version + every parameter + fill/filter order), not on the raw files alone. MS-DIAL's specific differentiator is **MS2Dec deconvolution**: it reconstructs clean, library-matchable MS/MS spectra from chimeric DDA/DIA fragment data, which is what makes wide-window DIA (SWATH) tractable at all. Report the full processing specification as part of the result, and treat a finding that survives only one pipeline as a candidate, not a result.

## MS-DIAL vs XCMS

| Axis | MS-DIAL | XCMS |
|---|---|---|
| Interface | Windows GUI + cross-platform console | R package (scriptable everywhere) |
| Core differentiator | MS2Dec MS/MS deconvolution (DDA + DIA) | centWave peak picking, full programmatic control |
| Annotation | Built-in (library + MS-FINDER + LipidBlast) | Separate (CAMERA, downstream tools) |
| Lipidomics | Strong (predicted-CCS / EAD structural elucidation in v5) | Manual |
| Reproducibility unit | Param file + GUI choices | Versioned R script |
| Best when | DIA data, lipidomics, GUI workflow, built-in IDs | Scripted pipelines, custom parameters, cohort scale |

Use MS-DIAL when DIA deconvolution or built-in lipid annotation is the point; use metabolomics/xcms-preprocessing for fully scripted, version-pinned cohort processing. The strongest untargeted claims replicate across both.

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Situation | Do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| LC-MS, top-N MS/MS (DDA) | `lcmsdda` console / GUI LC-MS DDA | Cleaner per-precursor MS2, but intensity-biased, stochastic coverage |
| LC-MS, wide-window MS/MS (DIA / SWATH) | `lcmsdia` (ABF input only) | Complete MS2 coverage; chimeric spectra REQUIRE MS2Dec to be usable |
| GC-EI run | `gcms` (MS-DIAL 4 build), or AMDIS/eRah | EI fragments every co-eluting compound; deconvolution IS detection (see below) |
| Headless / Linux cluster | MsdialConsoleApp with a `-m` param file | GUI is Windows-only; console is the reproducible batch path |
| Lipid-focused study | MS-DIAL + LipidBlast | -> metabolomics/lipidomics for lipid annotation mode |
| Already have an alignment CSV | skip processing, parse + filter | See import + honest-filter sections below |

## Why GC-EI Is Different (and stays in MS-DIAL 4)

In GC-EI, 70 eV ionization fragments every compound reproducibly, so the trace at any retention time is a superposition of fragments from several co-eluting molecules. Naive peak picking conflates them; **deconvolution into component spectra IS the feature-detection step**, then each component is matched against EI+RI libraries (NIST, FiehnLib). Cross-run/cross-lab alignment uses **retention index** (Kovats n-alkanes, or Fiehn FAME markers giving diagnostic m/z 74/87) rather than raw RT, because RT drifts with column aging. MS-DIAL 5-alpha explicitly excludes GC-MS; use the `gcms` token in a MS-DIAL 4 build, or AMDIS/eRah, for GC-EI work.

## Run MS-DIAL Headless (console)

**Goal:** Process a folder of converted spectra into an alignment table without the GUI.

**Approach:** Pick the analysis-type token, point `-i`/`-o`/`-m` at input dir, output dir, and a method (parameter) file; keep `-p` only if the project should reopen in the GUI.

```bash
# DDA LC-MS: accepts netCDF/mzML/ABF. Output is *.msdial in the output dir.
MsdialConsoleApp lcmsdda -i ./LCMS_DDA/ -o ./LCMS_DDA_out/ -m ./Msdial-lcms-dda-Param.txt

# DIA/SWATH LC-MS: accepts ABF ONLY (convert vendor raw -> ABF first). MS2Dec is the point.
MsdialConsoleApp lcmsdia -i ./LCMS_DIA/ -o ./LCMS_DIA_out/ -m ./Msdial-lcms-dia-Param.txt

# GC-EI (MS-DIAL 4 build): retention-index alignment, quant-mass quantification.
MsdialConsoleApp gcms -i ./GCMS/ -o ./GCMS_out/ -m ./Msdial-GCMS-Param.txt -p
```

The parameter file is plain text (one `Key=Value` per line). The `Minimum peak height` key is the direct analog of an intensity floor and is instrument-dependent: the GUI default is tuned for a TOF and is often far too high (or its baseline assumption wrong) for an Orbitrap. Set the alignment reference to a pooled QC, never to file #1 by default.

## Import the Alignment Result into R

**Goal:** Split the MS-DIAL alignment export into a feature-metadata frame and an intensity matrix.

**Approach:** The export carries four header rows above the real column header (sample class / file type / injection order / batch), so skip them; metadata columns precede the per-sample Area columns.

```r
# MS-DIAL alignment export: real column header is on row 5, so skip the first 4 rows.
msdial <- read.csv('AlignResult.txt', sep = '\t', skip = 4, check.names = FALSE)

# Metadata columns appear before the per-sample intensity columns. Common ones:
# 'Alignment ID', 'Average Rt(min)', 'Average Mz', 'Metabolite name', 'Adduct type',
# 'Fill %', 'MS/MS assigned', 'Reference RT', 'Formula', 'Ontology', 'INCHIKEY',
# 'SMILES', 'Annotation tag (VS1.0)'. Sample columns are everything after these.
meta_cols <- c('Alignment ID', 'Average Rt(min)', 'Average Mz', 'Metabolite name',
               'Adduct type', 'Fill %', 'MS/MS assigned', 'Annotation tag (VS1.0)')
meta_cols <- intersect(meta_cols, colnames(msdial))
sample_cols <- setdiff(colnames(msdial), colnames(msdial)[seq_len(max(match(meta_cols, colnames(msdial))))])

feature_info <- msdial[, meta_cols]
intensity <- as.matrix(msdial[, sample_cols])
rownames(intensity) <- msdial[['Alignment ID']]
```

## Import the Alignment Result into Python

**Goal:** Same split, in pandas.

**Approach:** `skiprows=4` to land on the real header; slice metadata vs sample columns by position after the last known metadata column.

```python
import pandas as pd

msdial = pd.read_csv('AlignResult.txt', sep='\t', skiprows=4)
meta_cols = ['Alignment ID', 'Average Rt(min)', 'Average Mz', 'Metabolite name', 'Adduct type', 'Fill %', 'MS/MS assigned', 'Annotation tag (VS1.0)']
meta_cols = [c for c in meta_cols if c in msdial.columns]
last_meta = max(msdial.columns.get_loc(c) for c in meta_cols)
sample_cols = msdial.columns[last_meta + 1:]

feature_info = msdial[meta_cols].copy()
intensity = msdial[sample_cols].set_axis(msdial['Alignment ID']) if False else msdial[sample_cols].copy()
intensity.index = msdial['Alignment ID']
```

## Filter the Table Honestly

**Goal:** Keep features supported by real signal and known confidence, without overtrusting annotation tags.

**Approach:** Filter on Fill% (cross-sample presence), require MS/MS support for any feature called identified, and tie the annotation tag to a real MSI confidence level rather than treating a name as proof.

```r
# Fill% is the fraction of samples with a DETECTED (not gap-filled) peak. Low Fill% means
# the feature exists mostly as gap-filled noise-floor integrals, which fabricate intensity
# (an honest 'below detection' becomes a positive number). 70% is a common floor.
keep_fill <- feature_info[['Fill %']] >= 70

# An annotated name without MS/MS is at best an MSI Level 2/3 putative ID (accurate mass
# only). Require 'MS/MS assigned == TRUE' before trusting any identity downstream.
has_msms <- feature_info[['MS/MS assigned']] == 'TRUE'

# Annotation tag confidence (do NOT treat a name as an identification). The exact tag
# vocabulary is MS-DIAL-version-dependent, so inspect unique(feature_info[['Annotation tag (VS1.0)']])
# and map the strings the build actually emits rather than hard-coding them:
#   Metabolite / Lipid  with MS/MS  -> MSI Level 2 (spectral library match)
#   Suggested*          mass-only   -> MSI Level 3 (putative, no MS/MS)
#   Unknown                         -> unannotated feature
feature_info$msi_level <- ifelse(feature_info[['Annotation tag (VS1.0)']] %in% c('Metabolite', 'Lipid') & has_msms, 2,
                          ifelse(grepl('^Suggested', feature_info[['Annotation tag (VS1.0)']]), 3, NA))

filtered <- intensity[keep_fill, ]
```

Confidence-level honesty and orthogonal-evidence identification belong to metabolomics/metabolite-annotation; this skill only routes the tag to the right level. Fill% / blank / drift filtering interacts with normalization-qc - process blanks and pooled QCs through the SAME run, then filter the aligned table.

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### DIA processed as DDA (wrong console token)
- **Trigger:** Running SWATH/DIA data through `lcmsdda`.
- **Mechanism:** `lcmsdda` does not deconvolve wide-isolation chimeric MS/MS, so fragments from co-isolated precursors stay mixed.
- **Symptom:** Library matches to the wrong compound; "clean-looking" spectra that fail orthogonal confirmation.
- **Fix:** Use `lcmsdia` (ABF input only); MS2Dec deconvolution is the entire reason to run DIA in MS-DIAL.

### Over-trusting the annotation tag
- **Trigger:** Filtering on `Annotation tag != Unknown` and calling the survivors "identified."
- **Mechanism:** A `Suggested*` tag is an accurate-mass guess with no MS/MS; a named hit without MS/MS is MSI Level 3.
- **Symptom:** A marker list full of confident-sounding names that do not validate against standards.
- **Fix:** Require `MS/MS assigned == TRUE` for any identity claim; map tags to MSI levels (see filtering section) and defer to metabolomics/metabolite-annotation.

### Gap-fill masquerading as measurement
- **Trigger:** Treating low-Fill% features as quantitative.
- **Mechanism:** Gap-filling integrates whatever signal sits in the m/z-RT box even when no peak exists, turning a true below-detection (MNAR, left-censored) value into a positive number.
- **Symptom:** "Significant" features that are mostly gap-filled in one group; shrunken fold-changes for on/off markers.
- **Fix:** Report per-feature filled fraction; gate on Fill%; for inferential stats prefer MNAR-aware imputation over naive fill (see metabolomics/normalization-qc).

### GC-EI run through an LC pipeline / MS-DIAL 5
- **Trigger:** Sending GC-EI data to MS-DIAL 5-alpha or treating it like LC peak-pick-then-group.
- **Mechanism:** MS-DIAL 5-alpha excludes GC-MS; EI needs component deconvolution, not adduct-style peak picking, and RI (not RT) alignment.
- **Symptom:** No GC mode available; or conflated co-eluting compounds and cross-lab RT misalignment.
- **Fix:** Use the `gcms` token in a MS-DIAL 4 build (or AMDIS/eRah); align on Kovats/FAME retention index.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Fill% >= 70% | Common untargeted practice | Below this, the feature is mostly gap-filled noise-floor integrals, not measurements |
| QC CV (RSD) < 20-30% | Broadhurst 2018 | Technical reproducibility floor; drop features noisier than this in pooled QCs |
| D-ratio (sd_QC/sd_sample) < 0.5 | Broadhurst 2018 | Keeps features whose technical variance is well below biological variance |
| Blank filter: sample mean > 3-5x blank mean | Broadhurst 2018 | Removes background/contaminant features present in process blanks |
| ~10x more features than compounds | Mahieu 2017 | One metabolite makes adducts/isotopes/fragments; counting features over-counts hypotheses |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| All columns land in one field on import | Header offset wrong; tab-separated export read as CSV | `skip=4` (R) / `skiprows=4` (Python), set `sep='\t'` |
| `lcmsdia` rejects mzML input | DIA mode accepts ABF only | Convert vendor raw to ABF (Reifycs ABF converter) before `lcmsdia` |
| `Annotation tag` column not found | Header changes across versions (e.g. `Annotation tag (VS1.0)`) | Match by prefix / inspect `colnames()`; do not hard-code the suffix |
| No GC-MS option in MS-DIAL 5 | 5-alpha excludes GC-MS | Use a MS-DIAL 4 build's `gcms` token, or AMDIS/eRah |
| Console command not found on Linux | Expecting the GUI executable | The GUI is Windows-only; run `MsdialConsoleApp` (cross-platform) |
| Few features detected | `Minimum peak height` default too high for the instrument | Lower it toward the real baseline; defaults are TOF-tuned |
