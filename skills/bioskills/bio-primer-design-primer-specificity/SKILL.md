description: Checks whether a PCR primer PAIR amplifies only the intended target genome-wide, using pair-aware in-silico PCR (MFEprimer-3.0, UCSC isPcr, NCBI Primer-BLAST) plus a primer3-py 3'-end-stability prefilter, against the correct database. Covers why plain BLAST is the wrong tool (it scores per-primer similarity, blind to 3'-terminal anchoring and to whether the two primers form a convergent amplicon in range), why a single 3'-terminal mismatch suppresses amplification while internal mismatches are tolerated, why intron-spanning RT-qPCR is defeated by processed pseudogenes that force a GENOME search not transcriptome-only, how to read a Primer-BLAST report (empty unintended-products means none passed its filter, not none exist), and that in-silico checking reduces but never replaces empirical validation. Use when confirming specificity, screening off-target amplicons, avoiding paralog/pseudogene hits, or checking SNPs under the 3' end. Design is primer-basics; dimers primer-validation; alignment read-alignment.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: primer3-py 2.3+ (offline prefilter). In-silico PCR tools: MFEprimer 3.x, UCSC isPcr, BLAST+ 2.14+, NCBI Primer-BLAST (web).

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show primer3-py` then `help(primer3.calc_end_stability)` to check signatures
- CLI: `mfeprimer --help`, `isPcr`, `blastn -help` to confirm subcommands and flags

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Primer Specificity -- Does the PAIR Amplify Only the Target Genome-Wide

**"Are these primers specific?"** -> Predict every amplicon the primer PAIR would generate against the correct database and confirm only the intended one survives -- because specificity is a property of a convergent, 3'-anchored, in-range PAIR, not of one primer's similarity to the genome.
- CLI: `mfeprimer -i primers.fa -d genome.fa` (or UCSC `isPcr`, or NCBI Primer-BLAST) predicts amplicons from the pair.
- Python: `primer3.calc_end_stability(primer, site)` ranks 3'-end anchoring -- the variable BLAST ignores.

Scope: genome/transcriptome-wide off-target and mispriming assessment of a chosen primer PAIR via in-silico PCR. Designing primers -> primer-basics. Intramolecular dimers/hairpins of the oligos -> primer-validation. General read alignment / building a BLAST DB -> read-alignment/bwa-alignment, database-access/blast-searches.

## The Single Most Important Modern Insight -- Plain BLAST Is the Wrong Tool, Because Specificity Is a Property of a Predicted Amplicon, Not One Primer's Similarity

1. **The unit of analysis is the amplicon, not the primer.** Amplification needs four things at once: the forward primer anchored, the reverse primer anchored, the two convergent, and the gap within the polymerase's range. BLAST evaluates none of these as a set -- it scores per-query local similarity and stops. So a clean BLAST is false confidence in BOTH directions: a primer with a perfect 5' region but mismatched 3' bases scores a high BLAST hit yet will NOT prime (false off-target), while a primer with internal mismatches but a perfect 3' anchor WILL prime yet may fall below BLAST's word size and be missed (false negative).
2. **The 3' terminus is the governing variable, and BLAST is blind to it.** A single 3'-terminal mismatch suppresses extension by roughly 20-100x depending on identity (A:G/G:A/C:C worst, A:A intermediate, G:T/T:G wobble weakest and NOT automatically safe), while internal mismatches are tolerated (Kwok 1990 *Nucleic Acids Res* 18:999). BLAST maximizes total alignment score and cannot tell a 5' match from a 3' match. Pair-aware tools (Primer-BLAST, MFEprimer, isPcr) use BLAST or a k-mer index only as a candidate FINDER, then apply a pair + 3'-anchor + product-size FILTER.
3. **Search the correct database or the answer is meaningless.** For RT-qPCR, intron-spanning primers do NOT escape genomic DNA: processed pseudogenes are intronless retro-copies that typically carry the exon-exon junction (3'-truncated retrocopies may not), so when present they amplify like cDNA -- the search must cover the GENOME (with pseudogenes and alt/unplaced contigs), not the transcriptome only. This is the most common RT-qPCR specificity trap.

## Why Plain BLAST Fails, Concretely

BLASTn defaults are wrong for a ~20 nt primer: megablast (the default `blastn`) seeds at word 28 and so cannot seed a 20-mer at all; plain `blastn` (word 11) does seed a perfect 20-mer, but its scoring and E-value defaults are tuned for long queries, so short or partial off-target hits fall below threshold; only `blastn-short` (word 7, short-query scoring) is the appropriate task -- and even then it scores similarity, not amplification. And BLAST evaluates each primer independently against the database; it never asks whether the forward and reverse hits face each other within an amplifiable span. So `blastn-short` is acceptable only as a quick EXPLORATORY check for gross multi-copy/repeat problems of a single primer, read with the 3' alignment inspected by hand -- never as the final specificity decision.

## Tool Taxonomy

| Tool / method | Citation | Mechanism / role | When |
|---------------|----------|------------------|------|
| MFEprimer-3.0 | Wang 2019 *Nucleic Acids Res* 47:W610 | k-mer index forbids a mismatch at the first 3' base, then nearest-neighbor scores stable binding; outputs amplicons + Ta/dG + dimer/hairpin modules; CLI/JSON | scriptable local in-silico PCR with thermodynamics; the default programmatic checker |
| NCBI Primer-BLAST | Ye 2012 *BMC Bioinformatics* 13:134 | BLAST candidate-find + convergent-pair + 3'-mismatch filter; "intended vs unintended products" report; any NCBI organism | tunable-mismatch, report-driven web check |
| UCSC In-Silico PCR (isPcr) | Kent (UCSC Genome Browser) | exact predicted product(s) of a pair on a chosen assembly, with coordinates | confirm the intended amplicon exists and is unique on a specific UCSC assembly; local batch |
| `blastn -task blastn-short` | Altschul 1990 *J Mol Biol* 215:403 | similarity seed at word_size 7 | EXPLORATORY single-primer repeat/multi-copy scan only |
| `primer3.calc_end_stability` | SantaLucia & Hicks 2004 *Annu Rev Biophys* 33:415 | dG of a primer's 3' end annealing to a site | rank candidate off-target sites by 3'-anchor strength (the BLAST-blind variable) |

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Any qPCR / quantitative assay | MFEprimer or Primer-BLAST against genome + transcriptome | off-targets and gDNA corrupt the quantitative number |
| Intron-spanning RT-qPCR | search the GENOME (pseudogenes), not transcriptome-only | processed pseudogenes usually carry the junction and amplify from gDNA |
| Genotyping / allele-specific | weight the 3' end; check SNPs under the anchor (dbSNP/gnomAD) | the 3'-terminal base is the whole assay (Kwok 1990) |
| Confirm intended amplicon on a UCSC assembly | UCSC isPcr | exact product + genomic coordinates on that assembly |
| Tunable mismatch sensitivity + report | Primer-BLAST (loosen/tighten the 3'-mismatch filter) | stress-test how robust specificity is |
| Quick single-primer repeat scan | `blastn-short` word_size 7, dust off | gross multi-copy triage only; never final |
| Multiplex (N primers) | run in-silico PCR over the POOLED primer set + all-pairs cross-dimer | the pooled set enumerates cross-pair amplicons (Fwd_A + Rev_B, convergent and in-range), which per-pair checks miss; Primer-BLAST does NOT check inter-pair dimers either (O(N^2)) |
| Eukaryotic target with gene families / segmental duplications | pair-level genome + transcriptome search | paralogs in conserved exons amplify multiple members; segmental duplications / recent CNV families (e.g. SMN1/SMN2) give two near-identical loci a pair cannot distinguish |

Default when uncertain: run pair-aware in-silico PCR (MFEprimer or Primer-BLAST) against the genome AND, for RT work, the transcriptome; require exactly one intended amplicon, no qualifying off-target, and 3' ends clear of common SNPs -- then still validate empirically.

## Run In-Silico PCR on the Pair

**Goal:** Enumerate every amplicon the pair would make against the correct database and confirm only the intended one survives.

**Approach:** Build the database index once, run the pair-aware tool, and read the predicted products; require a single on-target amplicon of expected size and no qualifying off-target. The commands below need the tool binaries and a genome/transcriptome FASTA, so they are NOT offline-spot-runnable here -- verify flags with `--help` against the installed version.

```bash
# MFEprimer-3.0 (local, thermodynamic; build the k-mer index once, then run)
mfeprimer index -i genome.fa
mfeprimer -i primers.fa -d genome.fa -o specificity.txt        # add --json for pipeline parsing; verify flags with: mfeprimer --help

# UCSC isPcr (exact products on one assembly; primers.txt = "name<TAB>FWD<TAB>REV" per line)
isPcr genome.2bit primers.txt stdout -out=fa

# blastn-short: EXPLORATORY single-primer repeat scan ONLY (not a specificity verdict)
blastn -task blastn-short -word_size 7 -dust no -query primers.fa -db genome -outfmt 6
```

NCBI Primer-BLAST (web, any organism): paste the pair, pick the organism and a database that includes the genome (not "RefSeq mRNA only" for RT-qPCR), set the max product size, and read the report.

## Rank Off-Target Sites by 3'-End Anchoring (offline)

**Goal:** Show why a candidate off-target site that BLAST would surface may or may not actually prime, using the 3'-anchor thermodynamics BLAST ignores.

**Approach:** For each candidate site (the complementary strand the primer would anneal to), contrast the overall duplex dG (`calc_heterodimer`, what a similarity search tracks) with the 3'-anchor dG (`calc_end_stability`); a 3'-terminal mismatch keeps the overall dG strong but collapses the anchor, so the site will not prime despite the similarity.

```python
import primer3

COMP = str.maketrans('ACGT', 'TGCA')
primer = 'GTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCG'
site = primer.translate(COMP)[::-1]                  # the strand the primer anneals to; primer 3' base pairs site[0]

def mut(s, i):
    return s[:i] + ('A' if s[i] != 'A' else 'C') + s[i + 1:]

sites = {'on-target': site, 'internal mismatch': mut(site, len(site) // 2), '3-prime mismatch': mut(site, 0)}

for label, s in sites.items():
    overall = primer3.calc_heterodimer(primer, s).dg / 1000   # what overall similarity tracks
    anchor = primer3.calc_end_stability(primer, s).dg / 1000  # the 3'-anchor BLAST ignores
    print(f'{label}: overall dG={overall:.2f}  3-prime anchor dG={anchor:.2f} kcal/mol')   # 3' mismatch: overall stays strong, anchor collapses
```

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### "BLAST was clean, so it is specific"
**Trigger:** Treating a per-primer BLAST result as a specificity verdict. **Mechanism:** BLAST scores similarity per primer, ignores 3'-anchoring and pairing. **Symptom:** primers pass BLAST but amplify off-target on the bench. **Fix:** use pair-aware in-silico PCR (MFEprimer / Primer-BLAST / isPcr).

### Intron-spanning RT-qPCR checked against the transcriptome only
**Trigger:** Searching "RefSeq mRNA" and concluding gDNA-safe. **Mechanism:** processed pseudogenes are intronless and carry the junction, amplifying like cDNA. **Symptom:** a genomic amplicon at the cDNA size; no-RT control is positive. **Fix:** search the genome (with pseudogenes); keep DNase + no-RT control.

### Misreading an empty Primer-BLAST "unintended" section
**Trigger:** Treating an empty section as proof of uniqueness. **Mechanism:** Primer-BLAST ignores any off-target with >=6 total mismatches OR >=2 mismatches in the last 5 bp at the 3' end -- equivalently it LISTS only hits with <6 total and <2 near the 3', so an empty section means "none my model predicts will amplify," not "none similar exist." **Symptom:** false confidence. **Fix:** loosen the mismatch settings to stress-test, and combine with isPcr.

### Wrong / too-narrow database
**Trigger:** Searching primary assembly only, or one chromosome, or a single transcript set. **Mechanism:** off-targets on alt/unplaced contigs, repeats, or paralog transcripts are excluded. **Symptom:** "unique" in-silico, multiple bands in vitro. **Fix:** match the database to the assay (genome + transcriptome for RT-qPCR; include alt/unplaced contigs).

### SNP/indel under the 3' end
**Trigger:** Validating against the reference only. **Mechanism:** an individual carrying a variant under the 3' anchor fails to amplify that allele (Kwok 1990 *Nucleic Acids Res* 18:999). **Symptom:** allele dropout in some samples. **Fix:** check primer 3' ends against dbSNP/gnomAD common variants and redesign (primer-basics).

### Checking a multiplex pair-by-pair instead of pooled
**Trigger:** Per-pair Primer-BLAST/in-silico PCR on a multiplex set. **Mechanism:** two off-target classes only appear in the POOLED set -- inter-pair cross-dimers (O(N^2), unexamined) and cross-pair amplicons where one pair's forward meets another pair's reverse convergently and in-range. **Symptom:** one channel silently fails or an unexpected band appears. **Fix:** run in-silico PCR over the pooled primer set AND all-pairs cross-dimer screening (primer-validation), not pair-by-pair.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Primer-BLAST ignores off-target if >=6 total mismatches OR >=2 in last 5 bp at 3' | Ye 2012 *BMC Bioinformatics* 13:134 | encodes the 3'-anchor biology BLAST lacks (its actual default filter) |
| 3'-terminal mismatch suppresses ~20-100x (A:G/G:A/C:C worst, G:T/T:G weakest) | Kwok 1990 *Nucleic Acids Res* 18:999 | why a 3' anchor decides priming; wobble is not automatically safe |
| `blastn-short` word_size 7, dust off | Altschul 1990 *J Mol Biol* 215:403 | short-query-tuned scoring/E-value; megablast (word 28) cannot seed a 20-mer, default blastn (word 11) seeds it but its long-query scoring drops marginal hits |
| Require exactly 1 intended amplicon, expected size | -- | the in-silico pass condition before empirical validation |
| RT-qPCR: search genome + transcriptome | Ye 2012 *BMC Bioinformatics* 13:134 | genome catches pseudogenes/gDNA; transcriptome catches isoforms/paralogs |

## In-Silico Reduces, It Does Not Replace, Empirical Validation

A passing in-silico check removes most bad designs but does not license an assay. Confirm empirically: a gradient PCR to find the annealing temperature giving a single product; a single band on a gel (or single fragment on a TapeStation); for SYBR qPCR a single sharp melt peak with no low-Tm dimer shoulder; and Sanger sequencing of the product to prove identity (a same-size off-target is invisible on a gel). State this honestly -- "Primer-BLAST said it is specific" is not validation of a quantitative assay.

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Primers pass BLAST, fail in vitro | per-primer similarity, not pair amplicon | run pair-aware in-silico PCR |
| RT-qPCR amplifies gDNA despite intron-spanning | processed pseudogene usually carries the junction | search the genome; DNase + no-RT control |
| Empty Primer-BLAST off-targets but multiple bands | filter hid a 3'-anchored off-target / wrong DB | loosen mismatch settings; search the genome incl. alts |
| isPcr returns nothing for the intended pair | wrong assembly / over-strict default match | confirm the assembly and target presence |
| `mfeprimer` errors on the database | index not built | run `mfeprimer index -i db.fa` first |
| Allele dropout in some individuals | SNP under the 3' end | check 3' ends vs gnomAD; redesign (primer-basics) |
