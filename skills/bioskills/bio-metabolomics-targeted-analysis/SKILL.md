name: bio-metabolomics-targeted-analysis
description: Designs and validates quantitative targeted metabolomics assays (MRM/SRM on triple-quadrupole, PRM on high-resolution instruments) to report absolute concentrations. Covers the internal-standard strategy (external cal -> global IS -> standard addition -> stable-isotope-labeled IS), weighted calibration judged by back-calculated %RE not R-squared, ion-ratio quantifier/qualifier confirmation, matrix-effect/recovery characterization, and ICH M10 method validation. Use when quantifying a closed panel of known metabolites with units, building or validating an LC-MS/MS assay, choosing an IS or calibration weighting, or judging whether a reported concentration is trustworthy. For untargeted feature detection see metabolomics/xcms-preprocessing; for group statistics see metabolomics/statistical-analysis; for flux/MID/tracing see metabolomics/isotope-tracing.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: R 4.3+, ggplot2 3.5+, Skyline 23.1+, pandas 2.2+, numpy 1.26+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures
- CLI: `<tool> --version` then `<tool> --help` to confirm flags

An absolute concentration requires three inputs the code cannot supply: an authentic reference standard (its certificate-of-analysis purity scales every reported number), a stable-isotope-labeled internal standard that co-elutes with the analyte, and a per-analyte validation record. Without these, the workflow below produces relative peak-area ratios dressed as concentrations.

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Targeted Metabolomics Analysis

**"Quantify these specific metabolites and give me concentrations with units"** -> Fit weighted calibration curves on authentic standards, normalize each analyte to a co-eluting stable-isotope-labeled internal standard, confirm identity by ion ratio, and report concentrations only within the validated range.
- CLI: Skyline builds the small-molecule transition list, integrates peaks, fits weighted calibration, and exports via the Document Grid.
- R / Python: post-export curve fitting, back-calculated %RE checks, IS normalization, ion-ratio confirmation, validation metrics.

## The Single Most Important Modern Insight -- A Concentration Is a Chain of Cancellations, and Matrix Effects Are the Term That Fails to Cancel

Ion suppression is competition for charge and droplet surface in the electrospray source: a co-eluting matrix component (phospholipids late in a reversed-phase gradient, salts at the void) steals ionization from the analyte. Suppression is a property of the co-elution, not of the analyte, so it is retention-time-dependent and lot-dependent. The only mechanism that truly removes it is a stable-isotope-labeled internal standard (SIL-IS) that sits in the identical droplet at the identical instant: the suppression cancels in the analyte/IS area ratio. An IS that elutes even half a minute away samples a different point on the suppression landscape and injects new error rather than removing it. Every other safeguard in this skill -- weighting, ion ratios, validation -- assumes this cancellation is working; the gap between a solvent calibration curve and a matrix-matched curve is a direct readout of how badly the IS is failing.

## Targeted vs Untargeted -- Different Experiments, Not Two Settings

| Axis | Untargeted (discovery) | Targeted (quantification) |
|---|---|---|
| Analyte set | Open -- everything ionizable | Closed -- a panel defined before acquisition |
| Output | Relative fold-change; often putative IDs | Absolute concentration for confirmed analytes |
| Instrument | High-res full-scan / DDA (Orbitrap, QTOF) | Triple-quad SRM/MRM, or high-res PRM |
| Validation | QA/QC framework (Broadhurst, mQACC) | Full bioanalytical validation possible (ICH M10) |
| Question | "What changed?" | "How much is there?" |

Targeted buys sensitivity and absolute quant by spending scope (only what is on the list is seen) and up-front method development. Common pattern: untargeted discovery -> targeted validation of the hits. Feature detection upstream is metabolomics/xcms-preprocessing; this skill begins once the panel and transitions are defined.

## Acquisition Mechanics -- MRM/SRM and PRM

A transition is a precursor-m/z -> product-m/z pair plus a tuned collision energy. On a triple quadrupole, Q1 isolates the precursor, the collision cell fragments it, Q3 isolates one product: the double mass filter is the source of MRM sensitivity. SRM monitors one transition; MRM multiplexes many. Each analyte should carry at least two transitions -- a quantifier (most intense/cleanest, used for concentration) and one or more qualifiers (orthogonal confirmation). PRM replaces Q3 with a high-resolution analyzer that records the full product spectrum in parallel, so transitions are chosen post hoc and isobaric interferences are resolved by exact mass; MRM still wins on absolute sensitivity and very large panels. Dwell time is the signal-accumulation time per transition; cycle time must stay short enough for at least 10-15 points across each chromatographic peak (convention). Scheduled MRM monitors each transition only within a retention-time window so a large panel keeps adequate dwell -- but a peak that drifts out of its window vanishes with no error message, the classic scheduled-MRM failure.

## Decision Tree -- Quant Goal -> IS + Calibration + Validation Depth

| Goal / situation | Internal standard | Calibration | Validation depth | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Clinical / regulated / PK number | One SIL-IS per analyte (13C/15N) | Multi-level weighted curve, judged by %RE | Full ICH M10 (accuracy, precision, MF, recovery, carryover, stability, ISR) | A number driving a decision must carry its evidence |
| Cross-study quantitative claim | SIL-IS per analyte or per RT/chemical cluster | Multi-level weighted | Accuracy/precision + matrix-factor on QCs | Comparability across runs demands characterized bias |
| Exploratory research, ranking | Few global IS, or per-class | 1/x^2 weighted, low-end %RE checked | Broadhurst/mQACC QC discipline (pooled QC, blanks, RSD filtering) | Relative comparison tolerates residual matrix bias |
| Dirty matrix, isobaric interferences | SIL-IS + high-res | PRM, post-hoc transitions | Selectivity dominated | Exact-mass product resolves co-eluters a unit-resolution Q3 cannot |
| Large standardized panel (600+) | Kit-supplied class IS | Single/limited-point (vendor) | Vendor + bridging study before pooling sites | Kit buys comparability and throughput, not per-analyte full-validation accuracy |
| Carbon source / pathway rate | (tracer, not IS) | -- | -- | Flux question: hand off to metabolomics/isotope-tracing; MID measures rate, not pool size |

The IS rule of thumb: ask how far (in retention time and chemistry) each analyte is from its assigned IS -- that distance is the size of the uncorrected matrix error. 13C/15N at non-exchangeable positions are preferred over deuterium: deuterium causes a small reversed-phase retention shift (the deuterium isotope effect) that can chromatographically separate the IS from its analyte so it stops correcting suppression, and labile deuteriums back-exchange to H. If forced to a deuterated IS, verify co-elution by overlaying analyte and IS chromatograms.

## Calibration and Weighting

| Weighting | When | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Unweighted (OLS) | Narrow range, near-constant variance | High points dominate; low-end bias on heteroscedastic MS data -- usually wrong |
| 1/x | Moderate range (1-2 orders) | Down-weights high concentrations; restores low-end fit |
| 1/x^2 | Wide range (3+ orders), the common LC-MS default | Aggressively down-weights the top; can over-weight the low end -- still compare, do not reflex |
| Quadratic | Genuine, mechanism-explained curvature (detector saturation) | Never to paper over a bad linear fit |

MS detector response is heteroscedastic -- absolute variance grows with concentration -- so weighting models the variance structure (1/x and 1/x^2 are parametric stand-ins for 1/variance). Select empirically: fit candidate weightings, then pick the one minimizing the sum of absolute back-calculated relative error (%RE) across levels, especially the bottom two or three. R-squared is the wrong instrument: it is dominated by high-leverage top points, so a curve with R-squared 0.999 can be +40% biased at the LLOQ. Use a fitted (non-zero) intercept; forcing the line through the origin re-introduces low-end bias. The blank (matrix only) and zero (matrix + IS) are diagnostic, not calibration points.

### Build a Weighted Calibration Curve With a Back-Calculated %RE Check

**Goal:** Fit a calibration curve on the analyte/IS response ratio and accept it by per-level back-calculation accuracy, not by R-squared.

**Approach:** Fit 1/x^2-weighted linear regression of response ratio on nominal concentration, back-calculate every standard, flag any non-LLOQ level outside +/-15% and the LLOQ outside +/-20%, and set the LLOQ to the lowest passing level.

```r
standards <- data.frame(
  conc = c(1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000),
  analyte_area = c(480, 2500, 4900, 12100, 24500, 49000, 121000, 245000, 488000),
  istd_area = c(100000, 98000, 99000, 101000, 100000, 98000, 101000, 99000, 100000)
)
standards$ratio <- standards$analyte_area / standards$istd_area

fit <- lm(ratio ~ conc, data = standards, weights = 1 / standards$conc^2)
standards$back_calc <- (standards$ratio - coef(fit)[1]) / coef(fit)[2]
standards$re_pct <- (standards$back_calc - standards$conc) / standards$conc * 100

# ICH M10: each calibrator within +-15%, +-20% at the LLOQ (lowest level)
tol <- ifelse(standards$conc == min(standards$conc), 20, 15)
standards$pass <- abs(standards$re_pct) <= tol
lloq <- min(standards$conc[standards$pass])
```

### Internal-Standard Normalization

**Goal:** Convert raw analyte area to a matrix-corrected response that the calibration curve maps to concentration.

**Approach:** Divide analyte area by co-eluting SIL-IS area per sample, then invert the same response-ratio calibration; matrix effect and extraction recovery cancel in the ratio.

```r
samples$ratio <- samples$analyte_area / samples$istd_area
samples$conc <- (samples$ratio - coef(fit)[1]) / coef(fit)[2]
samples$conc[samples$conc < lloq] <- NA   # below validated range -> not reportable
```

### Ion-Ratio Confirmation

**Goal:** Guard against quantifying an isobaric co-eluter as the analyte.

**Approach:** Compute the qualifier/quantifier area ratio per sample, compare to the mean calibrator ratio, and flag samples outside the tolerance window -- a drifted ratio means the quantifier peak is partly something else.

```r
cal_ratio <- mean(standards$qualifier_area / standards$quantifier_area)
samples$ion_ratio <- samples$qualifier_area / samples$quantifier_area
# SANTE/2020/12830 uses +-30% relative for LC-MS/MS qualifier/quantifier ratios
samples$id_confirmed <- abs(samples$ion_ratio - cal_ratio) / cal_ratio <= 0.30
```

MRM gives mass selectivity, not identity: two compounds can share a precursor->product transition (many acylcarnitines share m/z 85; lipids share head-group fragments). Identity needs retention time plus the ion ratio plus an authentic standard. Near the LLOQ the qualifier may fall below its own detection limit, so ion-ratio confirmation is usually only enforceable above a few times the LLOQ -- state that limit rather than hiding it. A single-transition method has no defense against isobaric interference and is a documented compromise, not a default.

### LOD and LLOQ

**Goal:** Set the lowest reliably quantifiable concentration from noise and accuracy, not from an extrapolated curve.

**Approach:** Estimate LOD from blank-signal scatter (S/N ~3) and confirm the LLOQ as the lowest calibrator meeting the +/-20% back-calculation and precision criteria; never anchor the curve below the real noise floor to claim sensitivity.

```r
blank_areas <- c(100, 120, 95, 110, 105)
slope <- coef(fit)[2]
lod <- (mean(blank_areas) + 3 * sd(blank_areas)) / slope   # S/N~3 convention
# LLOQ is the lowest calibrator passing +-20% %RE AND precision -- not 10*SD/slope alone
```

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### Matrix suppression unaccounted
- **Trigger:** Neat-solvent calibration, or an IS that does not co-elute with the analyte.
- **Mechanism:** Co-eluting phospholipids/salts suppress analyte ionization; with no co-eluting IS the suppression does not cancel.
- **Symptom:** Solvent and matrix-matched curves disagree; IS-normalized matrix factor far from 1; lot-to-lot drift.
- **Fix:** Co-eluting SIL-IS per analyte; map suppression zones by post-column infusion and move peaks off them; report IS-normalized matrix factor across at least six matrix lots.

### One IS shared across chemically diverse analytes
- **Trigger:** A single global IS used to correct a heterogeneous panel.
- **Mechanism:** The IS corrects suppression and recovery only for analytes co-eluting and chemically near it; distant analytes carry the difference of two suppressions.
- **Symptom:** Excellent CVs but biased group means -- precision (set by the IS correcting injection/drift) and accuracy (set by the per-analyte residual) are decoupled.
- **Fix:** SIL-IS per analyte, or per RT/chemical cluster; treat low CV as no evidence of correctness.

### Unweighted calibration over a wide range
- **Trigger:** OLS fit on heteroscedastic data; acceptance judged by R-squared.
- **Mechanism:** High-concentration points dominate least squares; the low end is fit poorly.
- **Symptom:** R-squared 0.999 yet +30-40% bias at the LLOQ.
- **Fix:** Compare 1/x and 1/x^2, pick by minimizing low-end |%RE|, judge by per-level back-calculation.

### Isotopic crosstalk between analyte and IS
- **Trigger:** IS-analyte mass gap below ~3-4 Da, or high IS:analyte ratio at the LLOQ.
- **Mechanism:** The analyte natural-isotope envelope bleeds into the IS channel (bends the high end, mis-read as saturation); IS isotopic impurity bleeds into the analyte quantifier channel (inflates the low end, biases the LLOQ badly).
- **Symptom:** Non-linear high end; a matrix-blank-plus-IS sample shows signal in the analyte channel.
- **Fix:** Choose an IS mass gap of at least 3-4 Da or a less-abundant SIL isotopologue transition; always run a zero (matrix + IS only) and require its analyte-channel signal below 20% of the LLOQ.

### Pre-analytical degradation
- **Trigger:** Delayed quench, freeze-thaw, slow time-to-freezer.
- **Mechanism:** Metabolism continues post-collection (glycolysis, esterases, redox auto-oxidation); labile metabolites collapse in seconds to minutes.
- **Symptom:** No chromatographic error -- the true value is biased before injection; low/variable adenylate energy charge across samples is the tell that quenching, not biology, drove the numbers.
- **Fix:** Cold (-40 to -80 C) aqueous-organic quench matched to the metabolite, measure freeze-thaw and long-term stability per labile analyte, control collection-to-freeze time as a study variable.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Calibrator back-calc within +/-15% (+/-20% at LLOQ), >=75% of >=6 levels pass | ICH M10 (Step 4, 2022) | Per-level accuracy, not correlation, defines a usable curve |
| QC accuracy +/-15% (+/-20% at LLOQ); precision CV <=15% (<=20% at LLOQ) | ICH M10 | Intra- and inter-day acceptance at >=4 levels |
| IS-normalized matrix factor CV <=15% across >=6 lots | ICH M10 / Matuszewski 2003 | Proof the IS cancels matrix effect; raw MF may be poor while IS-normalized MF ~1 |
| Carryover <=20% of LLOQ (analyte), <=5% (IS) | ICH M10 | Measured in a blank after the ULOQ; concentration-dependent, must be quantified not eyeballed |
| Selectivity: interference at LLOQ <=20% of analyte, <=5% of IS response | ICH M10 | Across >=6 individual matrix lots |
| ISR: >=2/3 of reanalyzed study samples within +/-20% | ICH M10 | Only test that catches incurred-sample-specific problems spiked QCs cannot |
| Ion-ratio tolerance +/-30% relative (LC-MS/MS) | SANTE/2020/12830 | Illustrative codified window; enforce only above a few times the LLOQ |
| >=10-15 points across a chromatographic peak | Convention | Reliable integration; sets the cycle-time ceiling |
| S/N ~3 = LOD, ~5-10 = LLOQ | Convention | Detection vs reliable quantification; LLOQ also bounded by accuracy/precision |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Curve accepted on R-squared, biased at LLOQ | Unweighted heteroscedastic fit | Weight (1/x, 1/x^2); accept by per-level back-calculated %RE |
| Deuterated IS gives lot-dependent ratios | Deuterium isotope effect separates IS from analyte; lost matrix correction | Use 13C/15N at non-exchangeable positions, or verify co-elution explicitly |
| High-end curvature mis-read as detector saturation | Analyte natural isotopes bleed into a too-close IS channel | Widen IS-analyte mass gap to >=3-4 Da; use nonlinear isotopic-crosstalk correction |
| Beautiful CVs, wrong group means | One global IS across diverse analytes -- precision/accuracy decoupled | SIL-IS per analyte or per RT/chemical cluster |
| Low samples after a high sample read high | Concentration-dependent carryover | Inject a blank after the ULOQ, randomize run order, report measured carryover |
| Skyline never ratios analyte to IS | IS not tagged Label Type = heavy and paired to its light analyte | Set Label Type heavy in the transition list; pair by molecule name |
| Validated assay, study numbers still wrong | Pre-analytical degradation (no error message) | Quench fast, measure stability, monitor adenylate energy charge |
