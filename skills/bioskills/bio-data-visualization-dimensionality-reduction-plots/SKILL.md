description: Produce and interpret PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and PHATE plots for high-dimensional omics data with rigor about which method preserves what (variance, local structure, manifold, transitions), hyperparameter sensitivity, and the well-documented limits of 2D embeddings. Covers PCA biplot/scree/loadings, t-SNE PCA initialization (Kobak-Berens 2019), UMAP n_neighbors/min_dist trade-offs, and the Chari-Pachter 2023 critique. Use when visualizing high-dimensional data — bulk PCA, single-cell embeddings, multi-omics integration projections.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: scanpy 1.10+, anndata 0.10+, scikit-learn 1.4+, umap-learn 0.5+, openTSNE 1.0+, phate 1.0+, ggplot2 3.5+, PCAtools 2.16+, matplotlib 3.8+.

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Dimensionality-Reduction Plots

**"Make a PCA / UMAP / t-SNE plot"** -> Choose a projection method aligned with what the plot must reveal — variance explained (PCA), local neighborhood structure (t-SNE), manifold approximation with some global structure (UMAP), or continuous transitions (PHATE). Set hyperparameters deliberately. Communicate the projection's limits and refuse to over-interpret 2D distances.

## The Single Most Important Modern Insight -- 2D Embeddings Distort

Chari & Pachter 2023 *PLOS Comp Biol* 19:e1011288 demonstrated that 2D embeddings of single-cell data lose >95% of the high-dimensional geometry — local neighborhoods are preserved by construction, but distances between distant cells, density estimates, and global topology are NOT preserved. The "specious art" of single-cell genomics is the practice of reading 2D layout as biology.

Practical consequence: a UMAP plot communicates "these cells are similar locally" and nothing more. Distance between clusters is meaningless. Density of points within a cluster is dominated by the embedding's repulsion parameter, not the underlying biology. A trajectory inferred from "the gap" between two clusters in UMAP space is an artifact unless validated against the high-dimensional data (RNA velocity, diffusion pseudotime, PHATE).

A second foundational paper is Kobak & Berens 2019 *Nat Commun* 10:5416 on t-SNE for single-cell: PCA initialization + early-exaggeration + multi-scale similarity kernels recover more global structure than default t-SNE settings. The same logic applies to UMAP via `init='spectral'` (default) and `min_dist`.

## Algorithmic Taxonomy

| Method | Preserves | Hyperparameters | Strength | Fails when |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| PCA | Linear variance (orthogonal, ordered) | n_components, scaling | Interpretable via loadings; deterministic; variance % per axis | Non-linear manifolds; high-dim data with few effective dims |
| t-SNE (van der Maaten 2008) | Local neighborhoods (Student-t similarity) | perplexity (typ. 30-50), learning_rate, n_iter, init | Crisp cluster separation | Global distances meaningless; cluster sizes deceptive; non-deterministic |
| UMAP (McInnes 2018, Becht 2018) | Manifold local + partial global | n_neighbors (typ. 15-50), min_dist (typ. 0.1-0.5), spread | Faster than t-SNE; better global preservation than default t-SNE; deterministic given seed | Still distorts; n_neighbors small -> shattered; large -> homogenized |
| PHATE (Moon 2019) | Continuous transitions, branching trajectories | k (knn), t (diffusion power) | Best for developmental trajectories; preserves transition geometry | Slower; less canonical for clustering display |
| Diffusion map | Diffusion distance | epsilon, n_components | Theoretically motivated; supports pseudotime | Less visually striking; less commonly used |
| MDS / classical MDS | Global Euclidean distances | n_components, dissimilarity matrix | Honest about distance preservation | Computationally expensive >5000 points |
| Isomap | Geodesic distance on knn graph | n_neighbors, n_components | Captures non-linear manifold | Sensitive to k; less popular than UMAP |
| Force-directed (PAGA, ForceAtlas2) | Graph topology | Layout-specific | Best for connectivity (PAGA cluster graph) | Not for dense cells; aesthetic |

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Bulk RNA-seq sample QC | PCA on log-vst counts; show PC1 vs PC2 with metadata color | Variance explained is meaningful for batch detection |
| Single-cell broad cluster overview | UMAP `n_neighbors=30, min_dist=0.3` after PCA(50) | Standard; preserves clusters; faster than t-SNE |
| Single-cell with delicate trajectories | PHATE OR diffusion map | Preserves continuous transitions |
| Cluster cardinality / boundary visualization | t-SNE with PCA init, perplexity=50 (Kobak-Berens) | Crisper cluster separation than UMAP |
| Multi-omics integration projection | MOFA factors + PCA, or UMAP of joint embedding | Per-omics projection often misleading |
| Spatial transcriptomics with histology | UMAP for transcriptional axis; SEPARATE spatial scatter | UMAP collapses physical space |
| Identify which genes drive variation | PCA biplot with loadings as arrows | Loadings are interpretable; UMAP/t-SNE has no loadings |
| Demonstrating batch confound | PCA color by batch -- if PC1/PC2 separates batches, batch is the dominant variance | UMAP can hide batch effect via local neighborhood preservation |
| Visualizing 50 conditions | UMAP/t-SNE for nuance; faceted PCA for interpretability | Method choice depends on question |

## PCA -- The Underused Workhorse

PCA is interpretable, deterministic, and the loadings explain WHY samples cluster — UMAP/t-SNE cannot do this. For bulk RNA-seq sample QC, PCA is the right answer 90% of the time.

**Goal:** Project samples into a low-dim space whose axes are linear combinations of features ordered by variance explained, then visualize PC1 vs PC2 colored by metadata.

**Approach:** Variance-stabilize counts (DESeq2 `vst()` / `rlog()`); run PCA on transposed expression matrix; annotate axes with variance-explained percentages; layer screeplot and loadings plot to support interpretation.

```r
library(DESeq2)
library(PCAtools)
library(ggplot2)
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = FALSE)
p <- pca(assay(vsd), metadata = as.data.frame(colData(dds)))
biplot(p, colby = 'condition', shape = 'batch', lab = NULL,
       hline = 0, vline = 0,
       legendPosition = 'right',
       title = paste0('PCA: PC1 (', round(p$variance[1], 1), '%) vs PC2 (', round(p$variance[2], 1), '%)'))
screeplot(p, components = 1:10)
loadings_plot <- plotloadings(p, components = 1, rangeRetain = 0.05)
```

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pca = PCA(n_components=10)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)
var = pca.explained_variance_ratio_

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
axes[0].scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], c=labels, alpha=0.7)
axes[0].set_xlabel(f'PC1 ({var[0]*100:.1f}%)')
axes[0].set_ylabel(f'PC2 ({var[1]*100:.1f}%)')
axes[1].plot(range(1, 11), var, 'o-')
axes[1].set_xlabel('PC')
axes[1].set_ylabel('Variance explained')
```

**Always label axes with variance explained.** A PCA plot without `PC1 (45%)` annotation is unreadable. If PC1 = 5% and PC2 = 4%, apparent "clusters" may be noise.

## t-SNE -- Kobak-Berens Modern Defaults

Default t-SNE (Maaten 2008) loses global structure. Kobak-Berens 2019 demonstrated that three changes recover it:

1. **Initialize with PCA**, not random — `init='pca'` (openTSNE) or pre-compute PCA scores as init
2. **High learning rate** — `learning_rate = n/12` (n = number of points), not the default 200
3. **Early exaggeration** — `exaggeration=12, early_exaggeration_iter=250` for large data

```python
import openTSNE
import numpy as np

# Kobak-Berens defaults
embedding = openTSNE.TSNE(
    perplexity=30,                          # 30-50 typical
    n_iter=750,
    initialization='pca',                   # NOT random
    learning_rate=X.shape[0] / 12,          # scales with n
    n_jobs=-1,
    random_state=42).fit(X)
```

```r
library(Rtsne)
set.seed(42)
ts <- Rtsne(X, perplexity = 30, theta = 0.5, pca_scale = TRUE,
            initial_dims = 50, max_iter = 750)
# Rtsne does not natively support PCA initialization; use external init via Y_init=
```

**Perplexity is the local-vs-global trade-off.** Low (5) -> local; high (100) -> global. 30-50 is standard for >1000 points.

## UMAP -- Modern Defaults and the Random-Seed Trap

```python
import umap
reducer = umap.UMAP(
    n_neighbors=30,        # local-global balance; 15-50 typical
    min_dist=0.3,          # tightness of clusters; 0.1-0.5 typical
    n_components=2,
    metric='euclidean',
    random_state=42)       # reproducibility
embedding = reducer.fit_transform(X)
```

```r
library(uwot)
set.seed(42)
um <- umap(X, n_neighbors = 30, min_dist = 0.3, metric = 'euclidean')
```

```python
# scanpy convention -- after sc.tl.pca, sc.pp.neighbors
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=30, n_pcs=50)
sc.tl.umap(adata, min_dist=0.3, random_state=42)
sc.pl.umap(adata, color='leiden', palette='tab20', frameon=False,
           legend_loc='on data', legend_fontsize=7,
           save='_clusters.pdf')
```

**`min_dist` controls tightness, NOT separation.** Smaller min_dist = tighter clusters. Does not change which cells cluster together — only how dense the rendering is.

**`n_neighbors` controls local-vs-global.** Small n_neighbors = local fragmentation; large n_neighbors = clusters merge.

**Random seed matters.** UMAP is deterministic given seed; without setting seed, results vary across runs. Always set `random_state` (umap-learn) or `seed=` (uwot).

**scanpy.pl.umap save trap:** `save='_x.pdf'` writes to `sc.settings.figdir` (default `./figures/`) with prefix `umap`, producing `figures/umap_x.pdf` — not the path specified. Default `dpi_save = 150` is below journal requirements.

## PHATE -- For Continuous Trajectories

```python
import phate
phate_op = phate.PHATE(knn=10, decay=40, t='auto', n_jobs=-1, random_state=42)
emb = phate_op.fit_transform(X)
plt.scatter(emb[:, 0], emb[:, 1], c=pseudotime, cmap='viridis', s=5)
```

PHATE preserves transition geometry — for embryonic development, differentiation trajectories, or any continuous-state biology, PHATE is more faithful than UMAP. For discrete cell types, UMAP is fine.

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### Over-interpreting UMAP distances

**Trigger:** Reading "cluster A is closer to cluster B than to C" as biological similarity.

**Mechanism:** UMAP preserves local neighborhoods; global distances are NOT preserved (Chari-Pachter 2023).

**Symptom:** Conclusion contradicts hierarchical clustering / RNA velocity / known biology.

**Fix:** Validate inter-cluster relationships against high-dimensional metrics (correlation, distance in PCA space, RNA velocity).

### t-SNE / UMAP without random seed

**Trigger:** Reproducibility request; figure differs between runs.

**Mechanism:** Both methods use stochastic optimization; default seed varies.

**Symptom:** Re-running the script produces visibly different layouts.

**Fix:** Set `random_state=42` (umap-learn, sklearn) or `seed=42` (R uwot/Rtsne).

### Perplexity too low for the data

**Trigger:** Default t-SNE perplexity (30) on small dataset (<500 points).

**Mechanism:** Perplexity > n/3 fails; cells artificially fragment.

**Symptom:** Plot shows "shattered" small clusters that don't correspond to biology.

**Fix:** For small n: perplexity = max(5, n/30). For very large n: perplexity 50-100.

### PCA without scaling

**Trigger:** `prcomp(X)` or `PCA().fit(X)` without scaling rows/columns first.

**Mechanism:** Genes with high absolute expression dominate variance; PCA captures library-size effect rather than biological variation.

**Symptom:** PC1 perfectly correlates with library size or with total expression.

**Fix:** Use `vst()` / `rlog()` (DESeq2) or log + scale (`prcomp(X, scale.=TRUE)`). For single-cell, normalize then `sc.pp.scale_data`.

### UMAP cluster shapes "interpreted" as biological signal

**Trigger:** Reporting that a cluster is "elongated" or "round" as biological observation.

**Mechanism:** UMAP cluster shape is an artifact of `min_dist` and `n_neighbors`, not biology.

**Symptom:** Reviewer asks "why is the immune cluster elongated?"; no answer except the embedding.

**Fix:** Do not interpret cluster shape. Report cluster membership and validate biology via marker genes.

### scanpy.pl.umap save writes to figures/ subdirectory

**Trigger:** `sc.pl.umap(adata, save='myplot.pdf')` with the expectation that myplot.pdf will land in the current directory.

**Mechanism:** `save=` is concatenated with `sc.settings.figdir` (default `./figures/`) and prefixed with `umap`.

**Symptom:** File not at the requested path; actually at `figures/umapmyplot.pdf`.

**Fix:** Set `sc.settings.figdir='/abs/path/'` AND `save='_descriptive.pdf'` so result is `figures/umap_descriptive.pdf`. For full path control use `matplotlib.savefig` after `sc.pl.umap(show=False)`.

### Default DPI 150 below journal requirements

**Trigger:** scanpy `sc.settings.set_figure_params()` default `dpi_save=150`.

**Mechanism:** Nature/Cell require 300+ DPI for raster.

**Symptom:** Figure looks fine on screen, rejected at submission.

**Fix:** `sc.set_figure_params(dpi_save=300, figsize=(4, 4))`.

### PCA loadings interpreted on UMAP/t-SNE coordinates

**Trigger:** "PC1 axis on UMAP" — projecting loadings onto UMAP.

**Mechanism:** UMAP/t-SNE coordinates have no linear interpretation; loadings are PCA-specific.

**Symptom:** Conclusion about "what UMAP-x means" that has no foundation.

**Fix:** Use PCA when loadings are needed. Show UMAP for visualization and PCA for axis-driving gene identification, separately.

## Reconciliation: When Methods Disagree

| Pattern | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| t-SNE shows distinct clusters; UMAP merges them | t-SNE over-emphasizes local structure; UMAP n_neighbors too large | Both views valid; check Leiden cluster assignments rather than embedding |
| PCA shows batch on PC1; UMAP hides it | UMAP preserves local neighborhood within each batch | Run UMAP only after batch correction; PCA is the canonical batch-effect diagnostic |
| PHATE shows continuous trajectory; UMAP shows discrete clusters | PHATE preserves transitions; UMAP "blobifies" continuous data | Use PHATE for trajectory display; UMAP for discrete cell-type display |
| Reproducibility breaks across re-runs | Random seed not set | Set seed; document version of umap-learn/openTSNE |
| Cluster boundaries differ between Seurat/scanpy UMAP | Different defaults for n_neighbors, min_dist, init | Standardize hyperparameters; report explicitly |

**Operational rule:** report ALL hyperparameters used (perplexity, n_neighbors, min_dist, random_state). State the embedding's interpretation limit ("local neighborhood; distances between clusters not meaningful"). For trajectory claims, validate with RNA velocity, pseudotime, or PHATE.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| t-SNE perplexity | 30-50 for n>1000; max(5, n/30) for n<500 | Maaten 2008; Kobak-Berens 2019 |
| UMAP n_neighbors | 15-50 default range | umap-learn docs; Becht 2018 |
| UMAP min_dist | 0.1-0.5 | Tighter for crisp clusters, looser for continua |
| t-SNE learning rate | n / 12 (Kobak-Berens) | Default 200 over-shrinks large data |
| PCA n_components for downstream UMAP | 30-50 | Standard scanpy workflow |
| Single-cell n_neighbors for sc.pp.neighbors | 15-30 | Wolf 2018 Scanpy paper |
| Save DPI for publication | 300+ | Nature/Cell figure guidelines |
| Random seed | 42 (or any fixed integer) | Reproducibility |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Plot differs between runs | Random seed not set | `random_state=42` always |
| PC1 = library size | No scaling/normalization | `vst()` or `log + scale` before PCA |
| Cluster shapes "interpreted" biologically | UMAP artifact | Do not interpret shape; report membership |
| scanpy save writes to wrong path | figdir + prefix concatenation | Set figdir explicitly OR use matplotlib.savefig |
| t-SNE fragments small dataset | Perplexity too high for n | Use perplexity = max(5, n/30) |
| Inter-cluster "distance" used in trajectory claim | UMAP distances not meaningful | Validate with RNA velocity / PHATE |
| Loadings interpreted on UMAP axes | UMAP has no loadings | Use PCA for loading-driven interpretation |

## Anticipated Reviewer Pushback

| Pushback | Standard response |
|----------|-------------------|
| "Why UMAP and not t-SNE?" | UMAP for cluster overview (faster, better global preservation given Becht 2018); t-SNE in supplementary if cluster boundaries are the focus |
| "What hyperparameters?" | Explicit n_neighbors, min_dist, n_pcs, random_state in caption AND methods |
| "Why is cluster X shaped this way?" | UMAP/t-SNE cluster shape is an embedding artifact; cluster membership is the biological observation |
| "Are these trajectories real?" | Validated via RNA velocity / PHATE / diffusion pseudotime (NOT inferred from UMAP layout alone) |
| "Why PCA?" | Variance explained per axis is interpretable for sample QC; loadings identify driving genes (uniquely PCA, NOT UMAP) |
