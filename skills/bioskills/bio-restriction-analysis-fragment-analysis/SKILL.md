## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: BioPython 1.83+ (API verified on 1.86)

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show biopython`, then check the return shape with `from Bio.Restriction import EcoRI; from Bio.Seq import Seq; EcoRI.catalyze(Seq('GAATTCGAATTC'))` (a tuple of fragment Seqs)

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Restriction Fragment Analysis

**"What fragments will this digest produce?"** -> Simulate the cut and return fragment lengths (and sequences), for one enzyme or a double digest, on linear or circular DNA.
- Python: `enzyme.catalyze(seq, linear=...)` returns a tuple of fragment `Seq` objects directly.

Two facts decide whether the prediction is right. First, **`catalyze()` returns the tuple of fragments itself** -- `EcoRI.catalyze(seq)` is `(Seq(...), Seq(...), Seq(...))`. Do NOT write `catalyze(seq)[0]` to "get the fragments": that returns only the first fragment, and iterating it then counts its bases, producing nonsense sizes like `[1, 1, 1, ...]`. Second, **topology sets the fragment count**: a linear molecule with n cuts yields n+1 fragments; a circular molecule with n cuts yields n. Passing the default `linear=True` to a plasmid invents one extra fragment that does not exist on the bench.

## Fragment Count By Topology

| Molecule | n cut sites yields | Why |
|----------|--------------------|-----|
| Linear (PCR product, genomic fragment, lambda) | n + 1 fragments | Cut once -> two pieces |
| Circular (plasmid, many viral genomes) | n fragments | Cut once -> one linearized piece; the origin-spanning fragment wraps |

A plasmid showing three bands on a single-enzyme digest has three sites, not two. Counting plasmid bands as if the molecule were linear is the most common digest-interpretation error.

## Predict Fragment Sizes

**Goal:** Turn a digest into the band sizes a gel would show.

**Approach:** Call `catalyze()` with the correct topology, take the lengths of the returned fragments, sort descending. The summed sizes must equal the molecule length -- a built-in correctness check.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Restriction import EcoRI

record = SeqIO.read('sequence.fasta', 'fasta')
seq = record.seq

fragments = EcoRI.catalyze(seq, linear=True)   # tuple of Seq; NO [0]
sizes = sorted((len(f) for f in fragments), reverse=True)
assert sum(sizes) == len(seq)                  # fragments must account for the whole molecule
print(f'{len(sizes)} fragments: {sizes}')
```

## Linear vs Circular Digestion

```python
from Bio.Restriction import EcoRI

linear_frags   = EcoRI.catalyze(seq, linear=True)
circular_frags = EcoRI.catalyze(seq, linear=False)   # plasmid: one fewer fragment
print(f'Linear: {len(linear_frags)} fragments; Circular: {len(circular_frags)} fragments')
```

## Double Digest

**Goal:** Predict fragments when two enzymes cut the same molecule.

**Approach:** A double digest cuts at the union of both site sets. The robust way is to build a `RestrictionBatch` and let `Analysis` collect every position, then compute fragments from the sorted positions (this generalizes to any number of enzymes and to circular DNA). Sequential `catalyze` calls also work but are easy to get wrong on circular DNA.

```python
from Bio.Restriction import EcoRI, BamHI, RestrictionBatch, Analysis

def fragments_from_positions(seq_len, positions, linear=True):
    '''Fragment sizes (bp) from a set of 1-based cut positions.'''
    cuts = sorted(set(positions))
    if not cuts:
        return [seq_len]
    spans = [cuts[i + 1] - cuts[i] for i in range(len(cuts) - 1)]
    if linear:
        return [cuts[0]] + spans + [seq_len - cuts[-1]]
    return spans + [(seq_len - cuts[-1]) + cuts[0]]    # circular: wrap-around fragment

batch = RestrictionBatch([EcoRI, BamHI])
positions = [p for sites in Analysis(batch, seq).with_sites().values() for p in sites]
sizes = sorted(fragments_from_positions(len(seq), positions, linear=True), reverse=True)
print(f'Double digest: {len(sizes)} fragments: {sizes}')
assert sum(sizes) == len(seq)
```

## Interpreting The Gel: Size, Resolution, And Topology

Fragment sizes are not what a gel directly reports; migration distance is. The decisions below come from gel physics, not from BioPython, and they determine whether predicted bands are actually resolvable.

| Reality | Consequence for interpretation |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Migration distance is ~linear in -log10(size) only within a gel's resolving window | Sizing is reliable only against a ladder run on the same gel; never reuse a standard curve across gels |
| Agarose percent sets the window (approximate, buffer- and voltage-dependent: ~0.7% resolves ~0.8-12 kb; ~1% ~0.5-10 kb; ~2% ~0.1-2 kb) | Choose the percent for the bands of interest; small fragments run off a low-percent gel, large fragments pile up on a high-percent one |
| Above ~20-50 kb fragments co-migrate (reptation); resolving them needs pulsed-field (PFGE) | Two large predicted bands may appear as one on a conventional gel |
| Two fragments of similar size co-migrate as one band of doubled intensity (intensity ~ mass) | A "missing" predicted band is often a co-migrating doublet, not an error -- check the sum |
| Uncut plasmid runs as supercoiled (fast, anomalous) + nicked (slow), same molecule | Do not size a supercoiled band off a linear ladder; only a linearized (single-cut) plasmid sizes correctly |

## Simulate A Gel Pattern (Text)

**Goal:** Lay predicted digests next to a ladder to see which bands resolve and which co-migrate.

**Approach:** Pool all band sizes and the ladder, sort descending, and mark each lane. Co-migration shows up as multiple marks at one size.

```python
def simulate_gel(digests, ladder=None):
    '''digests: {lane_name: [sizes]} -> print a text gel against a ladder.'''
    ladder = ladder or [10000, 8000, 6000, 5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1500, 1000, 750, 500, 250]
    bands = sorted(set(ladder).union(*[set(s) for s in digests.values()]), reverse=True)
    header = f'{"size":>6} | {"ladder":^6} | ' + ' | '.join(f'{n:^8}' for n in digests)
    print(header); print('-' * len(header))
    for b in bands:
        row = f'{b:>6} | {"---" if b in ladder else "":^6} | '
        row += ' | '.join(f'{"=" * 4 * lane.count(b):^8}' for lane in digests.values())
        print(row)

simulate_gel({'EcoRI': sizes})
```

## Diagnostic Digest Report

**Goal:** Document an expected digest to plan a clone-verification gel.

**Approach:** Report site count, positions, fragment sizes, and the total; flag any pair of fragments too close to resolve.

```python
def fragment_report(seq, enzyme, linear=True, resolution=0.10):
    sites = enzyme.search(seq, linear=linear)
    sizes = sorted((len(f) for f in enzyme.catalyze(seq, linear=linear)), reverse=True)
    print(f'{enzyme} ({enzyme.site}): {len(sites)} site(s) at {sites}')
    print(f'  {len(sizes)} fragments, total {sum(sizes)} bp: {sizes}')
    close = [(a, b) for a, b in zip(sizes, sizes[1:]) if a and (a - b) / a < resolution]
    if close:
        print(f'  WARNING likely co-migrating (<{resolution:.0%} apart): {close}')
    return sizes

fragment_report(seq, EcoRI)
```

## Compare Expected vs Observed Bands

```python
def compare_fragments(expected, observed, tolerance=50):
    '''Match predicted sizes to gel-measured sizes within a tolerance (bp).'''
    obs = list(observed)
    matched, missing = [], []
    for exp in expected:
        hit = next((o for o in obs if abs(exp - o) <= tolerance), None)
        if hit is None:
            missing.append(exp)
        else:
            matched.append((exp, hit)); obs.remove(hit)
    print('matched:', matched)
    if missing: print('missing (predicted, not seen -- co-migration or partial digest?):', missing)
    if obs:     print('extra (seen, not predicted -- star activity, contaminant, or wrong map?):', obs)

compare_fragments(expected=[3000, 2000, 1500, 500], observed=[3050, 2000, 1480, 510, 200])
```

Extra bands and a smeary ladder of intermediate sizes often signal a **partial digest** (not every site cut), which produces sums of adjacent complete-digest fragments. Drive the reaction to completion (more enzyme or time) before concluding the map is wrong.

## Common Errors

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Fragment sizes are all 1 (or wildly wrong) | `catalyze(seq)[0]` returns the first fragment, then `len(f) for f in it` counts bases | Use `fragments = enzyme.catalyze(seq, linear=...)` with no `[0]` |
| Predicted one fragment too many for a plasmid | Digested a circular molecule with `linear=True` | Pass `linear=False`; circular gives n fragments from n cuts |
| Fragment sizes do not sum to the molecule length | A band was missed or two co-migrate | The `sum(sizes) == len(seq)` check is mandatory; a shortfall means a hidden doublet or run-off fragment |
| Two predicted bands never separate on the gel | Sizes within the gel's resolving limit, or both >20-50 kb | Adjust agarose percent, or use PFGE for very large fragments |
