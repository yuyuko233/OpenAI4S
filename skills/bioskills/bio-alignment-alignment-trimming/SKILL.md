## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: ClipKIT 2.1+, trimAl 1.4+, BMGE 1.12+, Divvier 1.01+, HMMcleaner (current CPAN release of `Bio::MUST::Apps::HmmCleaner`), BioPython 1.83+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- CLI: `clipkit --version`, `trimal --version`, `BMGE --help`, `Divvier --help`
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Alignment Trimming

**"Remove unreliable columns from this MSA"** -> Filter or split columns based on gap fraction, conservation, entropy, or per-residue quality.
- CLI: `clipkit`, `trimal`, `BMGE`, `Divvier`, `HMMcleaner`
- Python: post-process via Bio.AlignIO with custom column masks

**"Make this alignment publication-grade for phylogenetics"** -> Apply ClipKIT's `kpic-smart-gap` mode, or trimAl `-automated1`, then verify via tree-stability comparison before vs after trimming.

Tool choice and aggressiveness matter more than trimming vs not-trimming. Pick a mode by dataset character (table below), and always run a sensitivity check by building trees on trimmed and untrimmed alignments.

### Pick a Trimming Mode by Dataset Character

| Dataset character | Trimming effect | Recommended approach |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Deep-divergence orthologs (>500 Ma), saturated 3rd codons | Aggressive trimming HURTS (Tan-style result) | No trim or `kpic-smart-gap` only; report sensitivity to trimming choice |
| Mid-depth eukaryotic (animal phyla, fungal classes) | ClipKIT `kpic-smart-gap` HELPS | Steenwyk-style result |
| Shallow (within-genus) | All trimmers ~equivalent | Choose for downstream-tool compatibility |
| Concatenated supermatrix with very long alignments (>10 kb) | Trimming reduces phylogenetic noise | `kpic-smart-gap` or BMGE `-h 0.5` |
| Single short genes (<200 bp aligned) | Trimming amplifies stochastic error | Skip column trimming; use sequence-level outlier filtering |

**The 20%/40% rule.** Tan et al 2015 (Syst Biol) and Steenwyk et al 2020 (PLOS Bio) appear to disagree but their conclusions are reconciled by trimming aggressiveness: light trimming (<20% of columns removed) has minimal impact on tree accuracy regardless of method; heavy trimming (>40%) removes phylogenetic signal alongside noise and degrades tree accuracy on most empirical datasets. Steenwyk's ClipKIT `kpic-smart-gap` improves trees because it stays in the light-trim regime; the older Gblocks defaults fail because they over-trim. **Operational rule:** if the trimmer removes >40% of columns, the mode is too aggressive for the dataset; switch to a less aggressive mode or skip trimming.

Always run a sensitivity analysis: build the tree on trimmed AND untrimmed alignments. If topology and support are stable across trimming choices, the conclusion is robust; if unstable, report this and pick the result better supported by independent evidence (gene-tree concordance, biological priors).

## Goal-Driven Tool Selection

| Downstream goal | First-line tool | Rationale |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Phylogenetic-tree input (concatenated genes) | ClipKIT `kpic-smart-gap` (Steenwyk et al 2020 PLOS Bio) | Retains parsimony-informative + constant sites; consistently produces better trees |
| Phylogenetic-tree input (single gene) | ClipKIT `smart-gap` | Default mode; dynamic threshold determination |
| HMM profile building (HMMER, HHsuite) | trimAl `-gappyout` (Capella-Gutierrez et al 2009 Bioinf) | Aggressive gap removal acceptable; profile quality benefits |
| Selection / dN/dS analysis (PAML, HyPhy) | TCS column masking or GUIDANCE2 (NOT aggressive trimming) | Removing columns causes false-positive selection signals (Fletcher & Yang 2010 MBE) |
| Deep prokaryotic phylogenomics | BMGE (Criscuolo & Gribaldo 2010 BMC Evol Biol) | Entropy-based with BLOSUM62 context; standard in GToTree pipeline |
| Cross-contaminated sequences | HMMcleaner (Di Franco et al 2019 BMC Evol Biol) | Per-residue cleaning; targets contamination not column quality |
| Preserve phylogenetic signal in indels | Divvier (Ali, Bogusz & Whelan 2019 MBE) | Splits ambiguous columns rather than removing them |
| Column-mapping retention for site analysis | trimAl `-colnumbering` | Outputs original-column indices for downstream cross-reference |
| Codon-aware trimming | MACSE `trimAlignment` (Ranwez et al 2018 MBE) | Preserves codon boundaries; pairs with MACSE codon MSA |

## ClipKIT Modes

Pick a `-m` mode by what the downstream task needs the alignment to KEEP. Run `clipkit --help` for the full list of 15 modes.

| Pick this mode | When |
|----------------|------|
| `kpic-smart-gap` | Publication-grade phylogenomics on concatenated supermatrices (recommended default) |
| `smart-gap` | Single-gene tree input or unbalanced datasets where `kpic` over-trims outgroups |
| `gappy` / `gappyout` | Need an explicit gap threshold or trimAl-equivalent behaviour |
| `kpi-smart-gap` | Maximum-parsimony tree input (drops constant sites) |
| `c3` / `cst` / `entropy` / `block-gappy` / `composition-bias` / `heterotachy` | Specialist needs: third-codon stripping, manual masks, entropy thresholding, conserved-block preservation, long-branch mitigation, or heterotachy filtering -- consult `clipkit --help` |

**Goal:** Run ClipKIT on an MSA with the mode appropriate to the downstream goal.

**Approach:** Pick a `-m` mode from the table above, optionally enable `--log` for reproducibility, and write the trimmed alignment in the desired format.

```bash
clipkit input.fasta -m kpic-smart-gap -o trimmed.fasta
clipkit input.fasta -m gappy -g 0.9 -o trimmed.fasta
clipkit input.fasta -m kpic-smart-gap --output-format phylip -o trimmed.phy
clipkit input.fasta -m kpic-smart-gap --log -o trimmed.fasta
```

The `--log` flag produces a per-column kept/removed log -- essential for reproducibility audits. ClipKIT also has a Python API (`clipkit.api.clipkit`) for in-memory trimming.

### ClipKIT kpic Failure Modes

`kpic` defines parsimony-informative as "at least 2 sequences with each of at least 2 different residues". On taxonomically unbalanced datasets (e.g. 95 close relatives + 5 outgroups), columns informative WITHIN the dominant clade look informative GLOBALLY, while columns that distinguish the outgroup from the dominant clade may have a single residue in the outgroup and fail kpic. Result: the trimmed alignment is biased toward the dominant clade's signal. Mitigations:
- Use `kpic-smart-gap` AND verify outgroup branch length is preserved before vs after trimming
- For unbalanced datasets, consider `smart-gap` (no kpic constraint) or sequence-weight-aware trimming (no production tool exists; manual subsampling to balance clades is the practical fix)
- ClipKIT does NOT use Henikoff-style sequence weighting; the count-based informativeness is unweighted (Steenwyk et al 2020 supplement)

For bias-aware trimming, BMGE's entropy thresholding with `-w` window weighting (default 3) is partially weighted but not by clade structure. ClipKIT GitHub issues #71 and #88 document the unbalanced-dataset failure.

## trimAl Modes

Pick a trimAl mode by downstream tool. `-gappyout` for HMM profile builds, `-strictplus` for phylogenetic tree input, `-automated1` only when audit-grade reproducibility is not required (heuristic has changed across point releases).

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Automated heuristic | `-automated1` | Picks `gappyout`, `strict`, or `strictplus` based on alignment characteristics |
| Gap-only | `-gappyout` | Automatic gap-fraction threshold from gap distribution |
| Strict | `-strict` | Combined gap + similarity criterion; recommended for phylogenetics |
| Strict-plus | `-strictplus` | Stricter; ~50% more aggressive than `-strict` |
| Manual gap | `-gt 0.5` | Remove columns with > 50% gaps (set fraction explicitly) |
| Manual similarity | `-st 0.5` | Remove columns with similarity below threshold |
| Manual conservation | `-cons 60` | Keep at least 60% of original columns regardless of other criteria |
| Sequence-quality | `-resoverlap 0.8 -seqoverlap 75` | Remove sequences with poor residue/sequence overlap |
| HTML report | `-htmlout report.html` | Visual diff of kept/removed columns |
| Column mapping | `-colnumbering` | Output original column indices preserved |

**Goal:** Trim an MSA with trimAl using a heuristic or manual threshold suited to the downstream tool.

**Approach:** Select an automated mode (`-automated1`, `-gappyout`, `-strictplus`) for typical use, or compose `-gt`, `-st`, `-cons` thresholds for manual control; export an HTML diff or column index mapping when audit-grade reproducibility is required.

```bash
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -automated1
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -gappyout
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -strictplus -htmlout report.html
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -gt 0.3 -st 0.5 -cons 60 -colnumbering > columns.txt
```

`-gappyout` is the recommended choice for HMM profile building (HMMER `hmmbuild` benefits from aggressive gap removal). `-strictplus` is recommended for phylogenetic tree input. `-automated1` is the safe default when characterising the dataset is impractical.

**Reproducibility note:** `trimAl -automated1` selects between `gappyout`, `strict`, and `strictplus` via internal heuristics that have changed between point releases (1.4 -> 1.4.1 -> 2.0-rc). For audit-grade reproducibility, do NOT use `-automated1`; specify the underlying mode explicitly. Record `trimal --version` in pipeline manifests. trimAl 2.0 (in development) is expected to change defaults; until release, pin to 1.4.1 in production environments.

## BMGE: Block Mapping and Gathering with Entropy

Use BMGE for deep prokaryotic phylogenomics (the GToTree default) or whenever entropy-based, matrix-aware column filtering is preferred over gap-only heuristics.

**Goal:** Filter MSA columns by matrix-aware entropy and gap-rate thresholds, particularly for deep prokaryotic phylogenomics.

**Approach:** Invoke BMGE.jar with `-t` (sequence type) and tune `-h` (entropy) and `-g` (gap rate) against the divergence depth of the dataset; recalibrate `-h` if the substitution matrix is changed via `-m`.

```bash
java -jar BMGE.jar -i input.fasta -t AA -of trimmed.fasta -h 0.5 -g 0.2

java -jar BMGE.jar -i input.fasta -t DNA -of trimmed.fasta -m DNAPAM100:2 -h 0.5
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `-h` | 0.5 | Entropy threshold (lower = more aggressive trimming) |
| `-g` | 0.2 | Gap rate threshold |
| `-m` | BLOSUM62 (AA) | Substitution matrix for entropy weighting |
| `-t` | -- | Required: AA, CODON, or DNA |
| `-b` | 5 | Minimum block size |

`-h 0.4` is the recommended setting for deep phylogenomics where conservation is low; `-h 0.6` retains more sites for shallower phylogenies.

**Matrix-aware threshold:** BMGE computes entropy weighted by the chosen substitution-matrix probabilities. The `-h 0.5` and `-h 0.4` thresholds are calibrated for BLOSUM62 (default). Switching to `-m BLOSUM30` (deep phylogenomics) makes the same numeric `-h` more permissive; `-m BLOSUM90` (close orthologs) makes it more aggressive. When using a non-default matrix, recalibrate by running on a known-good benchmark before applying.

## Divvier: Column Splitting Instead of Removal

Use Divvier when phylogenetic signal in indels matters and pure removal would discard block-boundary information; it splits ambiguous columns rather than dropping them.

```bash
# Divvier ships as a compiled binary; invoke as ./divvier or `divvier` if on PATH
./divvier -divvy input.fasta

./divvier -partial -mincol 4 -divvygap input.fasta
```

`-divvy` (default) outputs `input.fasta.divvy.fas` (full divvying); `-partial` only filters individual ambiguous characters. `-mincol N` sets the minimum number of confident characters required to keep a split column (integer count, default 2). `-divvygap` writes gaps instead of asterisks for phylogenetics-tool compatibility. Divvier is particularly useful when input alignments have many short conserved blocks separated by ambiguous regions -- removing the regions discards information about block boundaries that splitting preserves.

Maintenance note: Divvier's last release was 2019 (`simonwhelan/Divvier`); the tool is no longer actively maintained but results remain reproducible with the v2019 binary.

## HMMcleaner: Per-Residue Cleaning

Run HMMcleaner before column trimming when cross-contamination or annotation errors are suspected; it masks suspect residues with `X` rather than removing columns. Apply only to alignments with >= 15 sequences (below that the per-residue pHMM has too little signal and over-flags divergent residues).

```bash
HmmCleaner.pl input.fasta
HmmCleaner.pl input.fasta --no-large-remove
```

Output is `input_hmm.fasta` with low-confidence residues masked. Used in OrthoMaM and Compositional Heterogeneity-aware phylogenomic pipelines where cross-contamination from sequencing or annotation errors is suspected.

**Sample-size sensitivity:** HMMcleaner builds a per-residue HMM from the OTHER sequences at each position, so on small alignments (<15 sequences) the HMM has insufficient signal and over-flags real divergent residues as contamination. Di Franco et al 2019 show two related effects: pHMMs built from few sequences carry less signal, lowering HMMcleaner sensitivity, and its false positives are driven mainly by evolutionary divergence -- specificity falls with gap frequency, evolutionary rate, and the fraction of ambiguously-aligned regions rather than by a fixed sequence count (global specificity ~94% at default settings). OrthoMaM v11 and PhyloHerb pipelines apply HMMcleaner only to alignments with >= 15 sequences. For smaller alignments, manual inspection or BLAST-based contamination screening is more reliable.

## Gblocks: The Legacy Default

Use Gblocks only when matching a legacy pipeline; prefer ClipKIT or trimAl for new work. Default parameters are too aggressive -- always relax with `-b1=50% -b2=85% -b3=10 -b4=5 -b5=h`.

```bash
Gblocks input.fasta -t=p -b1=50% -b2=85% -b3=10 -b4=5 -b5=h
```

## PhyIN: Phylogenetic Incompatibility Trimming

PhyIN (Maddison 2024 PeerJ) is a complementary trimmer that flags neighbouring columns whose split patterns are phylogenetically incompatible (i.e. cannot share a tree). It targets a different failure mode than gap-based or entropy-based trimmers: ClipKIT, trimAl, and BMGE all evaluate columns independently, so a region with consistent gap structure passes their filters even if its character patterns are pairwise tree-incompatible (alignment artefact). PhyIN catches that case.

```bash
phyin input.fasta -o trimmed.fasta -w 5 -t 0.5
```

Use PhyIN as a SECOND-PASS trimmer after ClipKIT/trimAl when alignment artefact is the suspected source of incongruence in a phylogenomic dataset; not a replacement for first-pass column filtering. PhyIN's incompatibility test is signal-direction agnostic, so it does not distinguish "the alignment is wrong here" from "true incongruent locus" (e.g. introgression, ILS); only gene-tree comparison after tree-building can disambiguate. Reference: PeerJ 2024 paper.

## Decision Tree by Downstream Goal

```
What is the next step?
+- Phylogenetic ML tree (RAxML, IQ-TREE)
|  +- Concatenated supermatrix? -> ClipKIT kpic-smart-gap
|  +- Single gene? -> ClipKIT smart-gap or trimAl -automated1
|  +- Deep prokaryotic? -> BMGE -h 0.4 -g 0.2
|  +- Suspected cross-contamination? -> HMMcleaner first, then ClipKIT
|
+- Bayesian inference (MrBayes, BEAST)
|  +- Same as ML; trimming is acceptable but log column mapping
|
+- HMM profile (HMMER hmmbuild, HHsuite)
|  +- trimAl -gappyout (aggressive gap removal helps profile quality)
|
+- Selection analysis (PAML codeml, HyPhy)
|  +- DO NOT aggressively trim
|  +- Use TCS column masking (T-Coffee -evaluate) or GUIDANCE2
|  +- See alignment/multiple-alignment confidence assessment
|
+- Sequence logo / motif scan
   +- Light gap-only trim (trimAl -gt 0.5)
   +- Preserve all variable positions
```

## TCS Column Masking for Selection Analysis

TCS (Chang et al 2014 MBE) scores each column on a 0-9 scale by consistency across a pairwise-alignment library. The recommended dN/dS workflow:

**Goal:** Mask unreliable columns before selection analysis to prevent alignment errors from inflating false-positive dN/dS calls.

**Approach:** Build a library-rich consistency score via M-Coffee, evaluate the alignment against that library to obtain per-column TCS scores, then keep columns at or above a chosen confidence threshold using `seq_reformat`.

```bash
# 1. Generate library-rich consistency scores via M-Coffee (combines libraries from MAFFT, MUSCLE, ClustalW, ProbCons)
t_coffee input.fasta -mode mcoffee -output fasta_aln -outfile aligned.fasta

# 2. Compute per-column TCS scores against the same library
t_coffee -infile aligned.fasta -evaluate -output score_ascii > tcs_scores.ascii

# 3. Filter columns at a chosen threshold via seq_reformat (5-9 = retain columns scoring 5 or higher)
t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in aligned.fasta -struc_in tcs_scores.ascii \
    -struc_in_f number_aln -action +keep '[5-9]' -output fasta_aln > aligned_tcs5.fasta
```

Threshold guidance: TCS >= 5 retains columns confidently aligned by the majority of library methods; TCS >= 7 is a stricter operational convention on the seq_reformat 0-9 display scale. Chang et al 2014 do not prescribe an integer 5/7 cutoff -- on BAliBASE 3 and PREFAB 4 structural benchmarks they keep residues scoring above ~0.6 on the native 0-1 scale and drop columns scoring below 2, with TCS outperforming GUIDANCE and HoT. TCS-from-mcoffee gives substantially better column-confidence ranking than TCS-from-default-tcoffee because the library is more diverse. For the PAML branch-site test, Fletcher & Yang 2010 showed alignment errors inflate false positives dramatically (up to ~0.99 with ClustalW, ~0.13 even with codon-aware PRANK) and that removing gappy columns did not reduce them; confidence-based column masking (TCS, GUIDANCE2) is a common mitigation but was not evaluated in that study, since TCS postdates it (Chang et al 2014).

## MACSE Frameshift Markers Need Post-Processing

MACSE encodes detected frameshifts as `!` (within-codon insertion) and `*` (premature stop) in the nucleotide output. PAML codeml interprets `!` as missing data; HyPhy `BUSTED`/`MEME` interpret `!` as `N` but `*` triggers a parse error mid-sequence. Standard cleanup before downstream analysis:

**Goal:** Convert MACSE frameshift and stop markers into formats that PAML and HyPhy will parse correctly.

**Approach:** Replace `!` with gaps for PAML, and use MACSE's own `exportAlignment` sub-program with `-codonForInternalStop NNN` for HyPhy-safe output.

```bash
# Convert frameshift markers to gaps; replace internal stops with NNN
sed -e 's/!/-/g' aligned_nt.fasta > aligned_paml.fasta
java -jar macse_v2.jar -prog exportAlignment -align aligned_nt.fasta \
    -codonForFinalStop --- -codonForInternalStop NNN \
    -out_NT aligned_hyphy.fasta -out_AA aligned_hyphy_aa.fasta
```

`-codonForInternalStop NNN` replaces internal stops with `NNN` (HyPhy-safe). Without this step, the dN/dS run silently produces results that do not correspond to the alignment shown.

## Aggressiveness Cap

Compute the retained-column fraction and warn if it drops below 0.7. Trimming more than 20-30% of columns rapidly degrades ML tree accuracy on empirical data.

```python
def trimming_fraction(input_alignment, trimmed_alignment):
    return trimmed_alignment.get_alignment_length() / input_alignment.get_alignment_length()
```

If retention drops below 0.7, switch to a less aggressive mode or accept the original alignment unfiltered.

## Column Mapping for Reproducibility

When trimming for phylogenetic input, retain the column-index mapping so downstream site-specific analyses (selection per site, structure-mapped residues, etc.) can be back-traced:

```bash
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -automated1 -colnumbering > kept_columns.txt

clipkit input.fasta -m kpic-smart-gap --log -o trimmed.fasta
```

These two flags emit different formats. `trimal -colnumbering` writes a comma-separated list of the original column indices that survived (e.g. `0, 1, 2, 4, ...`) on stdout. `clipkit --log` writes a `<output>.log` file with one row per original column reporting `position\tkeep_or_trim\tsite_classification\tgap_proportion`. To compare runs across the two tools, parse each format separately and reconcile to a common "kept-column index list" before applying the index map for site-specific cross-reference.

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| ClipKIT empty output | All columns failed `kpic` filter | Switch to `smart-gap` mode (less aggressive); check input for non-amino-acid characters |
| trimAl "all sequences are identical" | Input has duplicates with no variation | Remove duplicate sequences first |
| BMGE Java OutOfMemoryError | Default JVM heap too small | `java -Xmx16g -jar BMGE.jar` |
| Divvier crashes on large input | Memory limits | Run on per-gene alignments rather than concatenated supermatrices |
| HMMcleaner reports "no contamination" | Input alignment too small (< 5 sequences) | Pool more sequences or skip per-residue cleaning |
| Trimming removes 80%+ of columns | Mode too aggressive for divergent input | Switch to `kpic-gappy` or relaxed-parameter Gblocks |
