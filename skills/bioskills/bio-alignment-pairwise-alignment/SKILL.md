## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: BioPython 1.83+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Pairwise Sequence Alignment

**"Align two sequences"** -> Compute an optimal alignment between a pair of sequences using dynamic programming.
- Python: `PairwiseAligner()` (BioPython Bio.Align)
- CLI: `needle` (global) or `water` (local) from EMBOSS
- R: `pairwiseAlignment()` (Biostrings)

Align two sequences using dynamic programming algorithms (Needleman-Wunsch for global, Smith-Waterman for local).

## Required Import

**Goal:** Load modules needed for pairwise alignment operations.

**Approach:** Import the PairwiseAligner class along with sequence and I/O utilities from Biopython.

```python
from Bio.Align import PairwiseAligner
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio import SeqIO
```

## Pairwise Library Selection

`Bio.Align.PairwiseAligner` is the right default for interactive use, scripting, and pair sizes up to a few thousand residues, but it is not the fastest or most scalable option. For high-throughput screens, very long sequences, or production pipelines, switch to a SIMD-accelerated or specialised library.

| Library | Speed vs Bio.Align | Alphabet | Scoring | Vectorization | When to use |
|---------|-------------------|----------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| `Bio.Align.PairwiseAligner` (BioPython) | 1x baseline | DNA / RNA / protein | Matrix + affine | C-backed Gotoh | Default, <10 kb pairs, interactive use |
| `parasail` (Daily 2016 BMC Bioinf) | 10-100x | DNA / protein | Matrix + affine | SSE / AVX SIMD | High-throughput SW or NW; benchmark loops |
| `edlib` (Sosic & Sikic 2017 Bioinf) | 100-1000x | DNA only | Edit distance only | Bit-parallel Myers | Read mapping, k-mer search, primer placement |
| `pywfa` / WFA2 (Marco-Sola 2021 Bioinformatics 37:456; BiWFA: Marco-Sola 2023 Bioinformatics 39:btad074) | Best for low-divergence | DNA | Matrix + affine | Wavefront, O(s) memory | Long, near-identical sequences (>10 kb, <5% diverged) |
| `mappy` / minimap2 (Li 2018 Bioinf) | Production reads-to-genome | DNA | Chain + base-level | k-mer chain | Long-read mapping, splice-aware DNA |
| `Bio.pairwise2` | DEPRECATED | -- | -- | -- | Migrate to `PairwiseAligner` (deprecated in BioPython 1.80; not yet removed; migrate proactively) |
| EMBOSS `needle` / `water` | ~Bio.Align | DNA / protein | Matrix + affine | None | Reproducibility, audit trails (fixed, documented default parameters) |

Speed numbers in the table are rough; benchmark on representative inputs before committing. Critical caveats:
- **WFA / BiWFA**: 10-100x faster than Gotoh below 5% divergence; above ~10% it converges to Gotoh complexity. Right tool for PacBio HiFi self-similarity or assembly-vs-reference; not for distant homologs.
- **edlib**: 100-1000x faster than Gotoh at low divergence (<5% errors); above ~50% divergence the effective speedup drops to ~64x. For high-divergence DNA (<70% nucleotide identity), prefer parasail's SIMD score-only mode.
- **parasail**: SIMD only realises its advantage on long sequences in amortised batch loops.

When uncertain which algorithm Biopython's aligner selected internally, inspect `aligner.algorithm` after configuration -- it returns the resolved variant ("Needleman-Wunsch", "Smith-Waterman", "Gotoh global alignment algorithm", "Gotoh local alignment algorithm", "Waterman-Smith-Beyer global alignment algorithm", "Waterman-Smith-Beyer local alignment algorithm") for deterministic auditing.

## Core Concepts

| Mode | Algorithm | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `global` | Needleman-Wunsch | Full-length alignment, similar-length sequences |
| `local` | Smith-Waterman | Find best matching regions, different-length sequences |
| `global` + free end gaps | Semi-global | Overlap detection, fragment-to-reference alignment |

### Choosing the Right Mode

- **Global**: Both sequences are expected to be homologous over their full length (e.g., two orthologs of similar size). Forces end-to-end alignment.
- **Local**: Conserved domains or motifs within otherwise dissimilar sequences. BLAST uses local alignment internally. Preferred when protein termini are highly divergent (termini accumulate mutations faster than core regions).
- **Semi-global**: One sequence is a fragment or subsequence of the other (e.g., primer to template, read to reference, detecting overlap between shotgun reads). Free end gaps prevent penalizing unaligned flanking regions.

**Common mistake**: Global alignment of sequences with very different lengths forces biologically meaningless terminal gaps. If sequences differ substantially in length, use local or semi-global instead.

### DNA vs Protein Alignment

| Scenario | Align As | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Nucleotide identity >70% | DNA | Sufficient signal at nucleotide level |
| Nucleotide identity <70% | Protein | Codon degeneracy masks signal at DNA level; protein alignment is ~3x more sensitive |
| Noncoding sequences (UTRs, intergenic) | DNA | No protein translation possible |
| Coding sequences for dN/dS analysis | Protein first, then back-translate codons (PAL2NAL) | Preserves reading frame for selection analysis |

When in doubt, align at the protein level. It captures functional constraint better because 20 amino acids provide richer signal than 4 nucleotides.

## Creating an Aligner

**Goal:** Configure a PairwiseAligner with appropriate scoring for the sequence type.

**Approach:** Instantiate PairwiseAligner with mode, scoring parameters, or a substitution matrix depending on DNA vs protein input.

```python
# Basic aligner with defaults
aligner = PairwiseAligner()

# Configure mode and scoring
aligner = PairwiseAligner(mode='global', match_score=2, mismatch_score=-1, open_gap_score=-10, extend_gap_score=-0.5)

# For protein alignment with substitution matrix
from Bio.Align import substitution_matrices
aligner = PairwiseAligner(mode='global', substitution_matrix=substitution_matrices.load('BLOSUM62'))
```

## Performing Alignments

**"Align two sequences"** -> Compute optimal alignment(s) between a pair of sequences, returning alignment objects or a score.

**Goal:** Align two sequences and retrieve the optimal alignment(s) or score.

**Approach:** Call `aligner.align()` for full alignment objects or `aligner.score()` for score-only (faster for large sequences).

```python
seq1 = Seq('ACCGGTAACGTAG')
seq2 = Seq('ACCGTTAACGAAG')

# Get all optimal alignments
alignments = aligner.align(seq1, seq2)
print(f'Found {len(alignments)} optimal alignments')
print(alignments[0])  # Print first alignment

# Get score only (faster for large sequences)
score = aligner.score(seq1, seq2)
```

## Alignment Output Format

```
target            0 ACCGGTAACGTAG 13
                  0 |||||.||||.|| 13
query             0 ACCGTTAACGAAG 13
```

## Accessing Alignment Data

**Goal:** Extract alignment properties including score, shape, aligned sequences, and coordinate mappings.

**Approach:** Access alignment object attributes and indexing to retrieve per-sequence aligned strings and coordinate arrays.

```python
alignment = alignments[0]

# Basic properties
print(alignment.score)                    # Alignment score
print(alignment.shape)                    # (num_seqs, alignment_length)
print(len(alignment))                     # Alignment length

# Get aligned sequences with gaps
target_aligned = alignment[0, :]          # First sequence (target) with gaps
query_aligned = alignment[1, :]           # Second sequence (query) with gaps

# Get coordinate mapping
print(alignment.aligned)                  # Array of aligned segment coordinates
print(alignment.coordinates)              # Full coordinate array
```

## Alignment Counts (Identities, Mismatches, Gaps)

**Goal:** Quantify identities, mismatches, and gaps in an alignment to calculate percent identity.

**Approach:** Use the `.counts()` method on the alignment object and derive percent identity from identity and mismatch totals.

```python
alignment = alignments[0]
counts = alignment.counts()

print(f'Identities: {counts.identities}')
print(f'Mismatches: {counts.mismatches}')
print(f'Gaps: {counts.gaps}')

# Calculate percent identity
total_aligned = counts.identities + counts.mismatches
percent_identity = counts.identities / total_aligned * 100
print(f'Percent identity: {percent_identity:.1f}%')
```

## Common Scoring Configurations

### PairwiseAligner Default Gap Penalties Are 0

`PairwiseAligner()` with no arguments uses match_score=1, mismatch_score=0, open_gap_score=0, extend_gap_score=0. Combined with a positive-scoring substitution matrix (BLOSUM62), this produces alignments with arbitrarily many short gaps -- gaps cost nothing while matches pay positive score. **Always specify gap penalties explicitly when using a substitution matrix.** BLASTP defaults: open=-11, extend=-1 with BLOSUM62; Smith-Waterman EMBOSS `water` defaults: open=-10, extend=-0.5. Inspect with `print(aligner)` after configuration to verify the resolved parameter set.

### DNA/RNA Alignment
```python
aligner = PairwiseAligner(mode='global', match_score=2, mismatch_score=-1, open_gap_score=-10, extend_gap_score=-0.5)
```

### Protein Alignment
```python
from Bio.Align import substitution_matrices
blosum62 = substitution_matrices.load('BLOSUM62')
aligner = PairwiseAligner(mode='global', substitution_matrix=blosum62, open_gap_score=-11, extend_gap_score=-1)
```

### Local Alignment (Find Best Region)
```python
aligner = PairwiseAligner(mode='local', match_score=2, mismatch_score=-1, open_gap_score=-10, extend_gap_score=-0.5)
```

### Semiglobal (Overlap/Fragment Alignment)
```python
# Free end gaps on query -- for aligning a fragment against a full-length reference
# or detecting overlap between reads
aligner = PairwiseAligner(mode='global')
aligner.query_left_open_gap_score = 0
aligner.query_left_extend_gap_score = 0
aligner.query_right_open_gap_score = 0
aligner.query_right_extend_gap_score = 0

# Free end gaps on BOTH sequences -- for overlap detection between two reads
aligner = PairwiseAligner(mode='global')
aligner.end_gap_score = 0.0
```

## Substitution Matrix Selection

**Goal:** Select the appropriate substitution matrix based on expected sequence divergence.

**Approach:** Match matrix to divergence level. BLOSUM and PAM number in **opposite directions**: higher BLOSUM = closer sequences; higher PAM = more distant sequences.

| Divergence Level | BLOSUM | PAM | When To Use |
|-----------------|--------|-----|-------------|
| Very close (<20% divergence) | BLOSUM80, BLOSUM90 | PAM30 | Recently duplicated genes, strain comparison |
| Moderate | BLOSUM62 (default) | PAM120 | General-purpose, most analyses |
| Distant (>50% divergence) | BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50 | PAM250 | Remote homology detection |

**BLOSUM62 is the universal default** (used by BLAST, most alignment tools). When in doubt, use BLOSUM62. Switch to BLOSUM80 for very similar proteins or BLOSUM45 for distant homologs.

**DNA matrices**: `NUC.4.4` (match=+5, mismatch=-4) handles IUPAC ambiguity codes. `HOXD70` is tuned for human-mouse whole-genome alignment from noncoding regions.

```python
from Bio.Align import substitution_matrices
print(substitution_matrices.load())  # List all 30 available matrices

blosum62 = substitution_matrices.load('BLOSUM62')  # General protein (default)
blosum80 = substitution_matrices.load('BLOSUM80')  # Close homologs
blosum45 = substitution_matrices.load('BLOSUM45')  # Distant homologs
nuc44 = substitution_matrices.load('NUC.4.4')      # DNA with IUPAC support
```

### Affine Gap Penalties: Biological Rationale

Gap penalties control how gaps (insertions/deletions) are scored. The **affine model** (`penalty = open + extend * (L-1)`) is almost always preferred over linear because it reflects indel biology: a DNA break introduces the first gap (costly), but extending an existing gap is mechanistically easier (less costly). This models the observation that indels in real sequences tend to occur as single contiguous events.

Typical values with BLOSUM62: gap open = -11, gap extend = -1 (BLASTP defaults). Setting gap open equal to gap extend (linear model) over-penalizes long indels and under-penalizes scattered single-residue gaps, producing biologically unrealistic alignments.

## Working with SeqRecord Objects

**Goal:** Align sequences loaded from FASTA files rather than hardcoded strings.

**Approach:** Parse SeqRecord objects from a FASTA file and pass their `.seq` attributes to the aligner.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

records = list(SeqIO.parse('sequences.fasta', 'fasta'))
seq1, seq2 = records[0].seq, records[1].seq

aligner = PairwiseAligner(mode='global', match_score=1, mismatch_score=-1)
alignments = aligner.align(seq1, seq2)
```

## Iterating Over Multiple Alignments

```python
# Limit number of alignments returned (memory efficient)
aligner.max_alignments = 100

for i, alignment in enumerate(alignments):
    print(f'Alignment {i+1}: score={alignment.score}')
    if i >= 4:
        break
```

## Substitution Matrix from Alignment

**Goal:** Extract observed substitution frequencies from a completed alignment.

**Approach:** Access the `.substitutions` property to get a matrix of observed base/residue substitution counts.

```python
alignment = alignments[0]
substitutions = alignment.substitutions

# View as array (rows=target, cols=query)
print(substitutions)

# Access specific substitution counts
# substitutions['A', 'T'] gives count of A aligned to T
```

## Export Alignment to Different Formats

**Goal:** Convert an alignment to standard bioinformatics file formats for downstream tools.

**Approach:** Use Python's `format()` function with format specifiers (fasta, clustal, psl, sam) on the alignment object.

```python
alignment = alignments[0]

# Various output formats
print(format(alignment, 'fasta'))     # FASTA format
print(format(alignment, 'clustal'))   # Clustal format
print(format(alignment, 'psl'))       # PSL format (BLAT)
print(format(alignment, 'sam'))       # SAM format
```

## Quick Reference: Scoring Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Typical DNA | Typical Protein |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `match_score` | Score for identical bases | 1-2 | Use matrix |
| `mismatch_score` | Penalty for mismatches | -1 to -3 | Use matrix |
| `open_gap_score` | Cost to start a gap | -5 to -15 | -10 to -12 |
| `extend_gap_score` | Cost per gap extension | -0.5 to -2 | -0.5 to -1 |
| `substitution_matrix` | Scoring matrix | N/A | BLOSUM62 |

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `OverflowError` | Too many optimal alignments | Set `aligner.max_alignments` |
| Low scores | Wrong scoring scheme | Use substitution matrix for proteins |
| No alignments in local mode | Scores all negative | Ensure `match_score` > 0 |

## Percent Identity: Definitions Matter

There are four common ways to calculate percent identity from the same alignment, producing different values:

| Method | Denominator | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| PID1 | Aligned positions + internal gaps | Gap-aware, conservative |
| PID2 | Aligned residue pairs (excluding gaps) | Always highest value |
| PID3 | Shorter sequence length | Length-normalized |
| PID4 | Mean sequence length | Best correlation with structural similarity |

**Practical impact**: Up to 11.5% difference between methods on a single alignment. Combined with different alignment algorithms, variation reaches 22%. Always report which method was used. The `counts()` method above uses aligned non-gap positions (similar to PID2).

## Statistical Significance: Karlin-Altschul

Use bit score (database-size-independent) and E-value (expected chance hits) to interpret raw alignment scores; never compare raw scores across scoring schemes. For non-default gap penalties or non-protein/DNA alphabets, generate empirical p-values via sequence shuffling instead of trusting the formula (`examples/empirical_pvalue.py`; for DNA, use the dinucleotide shuffle of Altschul & Erickson 1985 via `ushuffle`).

| Bit score | E-value (typical 1e6 db) | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|
| > 200 | < 1e-50 | Essentially certain homology |
| 50-200 | 1e-5 to 1e-50 | Likely homology |
| 30-50 | 0.01 to 1e-5 | Possible homology; verify with profile methods |
| < 30 | > 0.01 | Suspect; not significant |

Karlin-Altschul lambda/K are calibrated empirically per (matrix, gap-open, gap-extend) tuple; switching gap penalties without recalibrating produces wrong E-values.

**Mask compositional bias before scoring.** Low-complexity regions (poly-Q, proline-rich, leucine-rich TM helices) inflate raw scores. Pre-filter with SEG for protein or DUST for DNA, then run BLAST with `-comp_based_stats 2` (modern default; Yu & Altschul 2005 Bioinf, conditional) or `-comp_based_stats 3` for repeat-rich queries (Yu & Altschul 2005 unconditional; Schaffer et al 2001 NAR introduced the original level-1 statistics). SEG pre-filtering is complementary to `-comp_based_stats`, not redundant.

## When Alignment Is NOT Appropriate

Pick the alignment method by protein identity; below 15% identity DP alignments are statistically indistinguishable from random pairings, so escape to structure or pLM tools.

| Identity (protein) | Recommended approach |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| >= 40% | Any DP aligner; Bio.Align or BLAST is sufficient |
| 25-40% | Use sensitive iterative methods (MMseqs2 iterative, BLASTP with composition-based statistics) |
| 15-25% | Profile-profile (HHsearch, HMMER `phmmer`/`jackhmmer`) |
| < 15% | Structural alignment (Foldseek, TM-align, US-align) or pLM embeddings (TM-Vec, ESM-2 + cosine) -- see structural-alignment |

Length amplifies the signal: 30% identity over 200 residues is far more reliable than 30% over 50.

**When pairwise becomes the wrong tool.** A single DP pairwise alignment is correct for two sequences. For one query against thousands to millions of targets (genome-scale homology search) or for many-vs-many all-by-all (clustering, ortholog detection), the right tool is profile- or k-mer-indexed search, not iterated DP:
- BLASTP / DIAMOND -- standard query-vs-database baseline
- MMseqs2 (Steinegger & Soding 2017 Nat Biotech) -- ~400x faster than PSI-BLAST at higher sensitivity; iterative profile mode `--num-iterations 3` matches PSI-BLAST and approaches `jackhmmer`
- MMseqs2-GPU (Kallenborn et al 2025 Nat Methods 22:2024; Mirdita co-author) -- GPU-accelerated; ~177x faster than `jackhmmer` for single queries on one NVIDIA L40S; use when GPU is available and the dataset is sensitivity-bound
- jackhmmer (HMMER) -- gold standard for distant homology when run to convergence; slow but the most sensitive non-structural method
- Foldseek -- escape to structural search when both query and database have predicted structures (see `alignment/structural-alignment`)

Other failure modes:
- **Non-homologous sequences**: All DP aligners return an alignment regardless of homology. E-value or bit score is the homology gate, not the existence of an alignment.
- **Repetitive sequences**: Tandem repeats produce ambiguous, artifactually high-scoring alignments; mask first.
- **NUC.4.4 IUPAC partial matches**: Biopython's NUC.4.4 matrix scores partial-match IUPAC codes (e.g. `R` vs `A`) as +1 rather than +5; verify behaviour with `print(substitution_matrices.load('NUC.4.4'))` before relying on ambiguity-aware scoring.
