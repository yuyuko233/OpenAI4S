# ChIP-Rx spike-in normalization end-to-end: from per-sample Drosophila read
# counts -> scaling factors -> DiffBind / DESeq2 application -> internal-control
# validation. Required for HDAC/BET/EZH2 inhibitor experiments and any setting
# where reads-in-peaks normalization would force median log2FC to zero.
#
# Patel et al 2024 (Nat Biotechnol) survey: improper spike-in normalization is
# common (only ~half of surveyed datasets had adequate matched inputs). Typical
# errors detectable from methods: peak-count vs read-level application, missing
# deduplication, wrong inverse convention. This script implements the validated
# pipeline.

# === 1. Spike-in read counts per sample ===
# These must come from POST-dedup, POST-mapq-30 alignments to the spike genome.
# Egan 2016 spikes a fixed MASS of Drosophila S2 chromatin, matched to target
# chromatin by the ~27:1 human:Drosophila genome-copy ratio. Add BEFORE IP, not after.

# Sample with fewest spike reads gets scale_factor = 1 (the max); others get < 1.

# === 5. Internal-control sanity check (mandatory) ===

# housekeeping promoters (U6 snRNA, etc) should show NO signal change between
# conditions. If they do, scaling is broken.
