# Treatment Effect Measures for Clinical Trials

**"Compute treatment effect sizes"** -> Estimate the population-level treatment contrast (OR, RR, RD, HR, NNT) with a confidence interval calibrated to sample size and a clear declaration of whether the estimand is marginal or conditional under ICH E9(R1).

## Algorithmic Taxonomy

| Measure | Scale | Collapsible? | Best CI method | When to use | Fails when |
|---------|-------|--------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| OR | Log-odds ratio | NO (non-collapsible) | Profile likelihood; Wald acceptable for n>100 per arm | Case-control (only valid measure); logistic regression default | Outcome prevalence > 10% (OR overstates RR); Hauck-Donner pathology near boundary |
| RR | Log-risk ratio | YES | Miettinen-Nurminen score; MOVER-R | Cohort, RCT with common outcomes | Sparse strata; one or both p near 0 (Wald log-RR breaks) |
| RD (absolute risk difference) | Linear probability | YES | Newcombe-Wilson hybrid; Miettinen-Nurminen | Clinically interpretable absolute scale; FDA-preferred for binary | Predictions outside [0,1] from linear models |
| HR (hazard ratio) | Log-hazard ratio | NO | Wald with profile likelihood for small n | Time-to-event with PH | PH violation (see clinical-biostatistics/survival-analysis) |
| NNT/NNH | 1/RD | n/a (derived from RD) | Bender 2001 *CCT* 22:102 (Altman 1998 base) | Communicating absolute benefit to clinicians | RD CI crosses zero (NNT becomes NNTB-infinity-NNTH) |
| Difference in RMST | Time scale | YES | Wald with delta method; pseudo-observation regression | Time-to-event with PH violation | Different max follow-up across arms (truncation tau ambiguous) |

**Postdoc reading:** Permutt 2020 *Stat Biopharm Res* 12:45 ("Do covariates change the estimand?") established that the conditional OR from a multivariable logistic regression is a *different parameter* than the marginal OR -- and the FDA May 2023 Final Guidance "Adjusting for Covariates in RCTs" requires the **marginal** estimand for primary reporting (see clinical-biostatistics/logistic-regression for g-computation/standardisation machinery).

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Scenario | Recommended estimand + CI | Why |
|----------|---------------------------|-----|
| RCT, binary outcome, prevalence <10% | OR with Wald CI; report as primary | OR ~= RR at low prevalence; standard regulatory currency |
| RCT, binary outcome, prevalence >=10% | RR or RD via modified Poisson with HC1/HC3 sandwich SE; OR as secondary | OR substantially overstates RR; modified Poisson directly estimates RR (Zou 2004 *AJE* 159:702) |
| RCT, binary outcome, primary endpoint per FDA 2023 | Marginal RD via g-computation with sandwich SE; conditional OR as supportive | FDA 2023 final guidance: marginal estimand for primary; cite Permutt 2020 |
| Case-control study | OR only (RR unidentifiable); profile likelihood CI | OR is the only measure estimable from case-control design |
| Noninferiority on absolute scale | Miettinen-Nurminen score CI for RD | Regulatory standard for RD CIs; consistent with Pearson chi-square |
| Noninferiority on relative scale | Miettinen-Nurminen score CI for RR; Koopman 1984 acceptable | Wald log-RR has poor coverage near boundary; MN is the regulatory expectation |
| Stratified design with site/region strata | MH pooled OR with stratified MN CI (R `ratesci::scoreci(..., stratified=TRUE)`) | Preserves stratification; cite Kahan-Morris 2012 |
| Reporting NNT for clinicians | Bender 2001 *CCT* 22:102 method; report as NNTB(lower)..infinity..NNTH(upper) when CI crosses zero | Standard in BMJ/Lancet/Cochrane |
| Time-to-event with PH violation | RMST difference; cite Royston-Parmar 2013, Uno 2014 | HR is a misleading single-number summary under non-PH (see survival-analysis) |

## Crude Effect Measures from 2x2 Tables

**Goal:** Compute unadjusted OR, RR, RD from a contingency table with calibrated CIs.

**Approach:** Use Table2x2 for OR/RR with Wald CIs, but switch to score-based methods (Miettinen-Nurminen, Newcombe-Wilson) for regulatory contexts.

```python
from statsmodels.stats.contingency_tables import Table2x2
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import confint_proportions_2indep
import numpy as np

# Table layout: [[treated_event, treated_no_event], [control_event, control_no_event]]
table = np.array([[a, b], [c, d]])
t = Table2x2(table)
print('OR:', t.oddsratio, t.oddsratio_confint())        # Wald log-OR CI
print('RR:', t.riskratio, t.riskratio_confint())         # Wald log-RR CI

# Modern CI for RD (regulatory preferred):
ci_rd = confint_proportions_2indep(a, a+b, c, c+d, method='newcomb', alpha=0.05)
# 'newcomb' = Newcombe-Wilson hybrid; 'agresti-caffo' is the +1+1 +1+1 adjustment
# For Miettinen-Nurminen stratified CIs, use R `ratesci::scoreci`
```

**Table orientation is critical:** Table2x2 interprets the first column as "outcome present." `pd.crosstab` orders columns alphabetically; if outcome is coded 0/1, the table will have 0 first and the OR will be the *reciprocal* of intended. Always reorder: `cross = cross[[1, 0]]` or `cross = cross[['Yes', 'No']]`. This is a silent direction-reversing error.

**For the underlying significance test of a 2x2:** Pearson chi-square (no Yates) at n>=40 with adequate expected counts; otherwise Boschloo's exact (uniformly more powerful than Fisher's exact at the same Type-I per Mehta-Senchaudhuri 2003; Lydersen-Fagerland-Laake 2009). See clinical-biostatistics/categorical-tests for the algorithmic taxonomy.

## Modern Confidence Intervals -- the Postdoc Toolkit

Wald CIs are the textbook default but have well-documented coverage failures (Brown-Cai-DasGupta 2001 *Stat Sci* 16:101 -- "chaotic" coverage near 0 and 1 even with moderate n; Newcombe 1998a *Stat Med* 17:873 documents 11 alternatives for the difference of two proportions).

### Single proportion

| Method | When | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Wald | Never preferred | Defunct for serious work; coverage can drop to 0.0 (Brown-Cai-DasGupta) |
| Wilson (score) | General default | Brown-Cai-DasGupta recommended; matches Pearson chi-square test |
| Jeffreys (Beta(1/2,1/2)) | Small n | Equal-tailed Jeffreys; Bayesian with reference prior; recommended for small n |
| Clopper-Pearson | When exact guarantee required | Over-covers by 1-4 percentage points; sometimes regulatory-required |
| Agresti-Coull | Simple Wald replacement | +2/+2 adjustment; teaching default |
| Mid-p Clopper-Pearson | When CP over-coverage hurts NI margin | Less conservative than CP; slight under-coverage |

```python
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportion_confint
ci = proportion_confint(45, 60, alpha=0.05, method='wilson')
# Other methods: 'jeffreys', 'agresti_coull', 'beta' (Clopper-Pearson), 'normal' (Wald)
```

### Difference of two proportions (RD)

| Method | Citation | Verdict |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Wald | textbook | Poor; can produce limits outside [-1,1] |
| Newcombe-Wilson hybrid / MOVER | Newcombe 1998a | Recommended; balanced of computational simplicity and coverage |
| Agresti-Caffo (+1+1, +1+1) | Agresti-Caffo 2000 *Am Stat* 54:280 | Add 1 success + 1 failure per arm, then Wald; surprisingly good for small n |
| Miettinen-Nurminen score | Miettinen-Nurminen 1985 *Stat Med* 4:213 | **Regulatory standard for RD**; consistent with Pearson chi-square; SAS PROC FREQ `riskdiff(method=mn)` |
| Chan-Zhang exact unconditional | Chan-Zhang 1999 *Biometrics* 55:1202 | Guaranteed coverage; needed when MN under-covers near extreme p |

### Ratio of two proportions (RR)

| Method | Citation | Verdict |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Wald on log(RR) ("Katz log") | textbook (Katz 1978) | Defunct for serious work; biased when either p small |
| Koopman 1984 score | *Biometrics* 40:513 | Iterative; original score CI for RR |
| Miettinen-Nurminen score | Miettinen-Nurminen 1985 | Regulatory standard; R `ratesci::scoreci(contrast='RR')` |
| MOVER-R | Donner-Zou 2012 *Stat Methods Med Res* 21:347 | Construct CI on theta1 - R*theta2 not on R directly; allows asymmetric CIs |

### Odds ratio

| Method | Citation | Verdict |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Wald on log(OR) | textbook | Fast; suffers Hauck-Donner effect when cell counts small |
| Cornfield exact | Cornfield 1956 | Exact reference standard; often over-conservative |
| Mid-p Cornfield | Berry-Armitage 1995 *Statistician* 44:417 | Less conservative; slight under-coverage |
| Profile likelihood | Venzon-Moolgavkar 1988 *Appl Stat* 37:87 | **Transformation-invariant; no Hauck-Donner pathology**; R `MASS::confint.glm` default for `glm` |

**Hauck-Donner effect (1977 *JASA* 72:851; revived by Yee 2022 *JASA* 117:1763):** the Wald test statistic is *non-monotonic* in the parameter estimate near the boundary -- a large OR can produce a tiny Wald chi-square so the test fails to reject when it should. Use LR or profile-likelihood inference. `VGAM::hdeff()` detects this in fitted models.

## Number Needed to Treat (NNT) -- the Bender 2001 *CCT* 22:102 Way

**Goal:** Convert RD to clinically intuitive NNT with a CI that handles the singularity at RD = 0.

**Approach:** Compute RD CI first, then transform; when RD CI crosses zero, report NNTB(lower) -> infinity -> NNTH(upper).

```python
import numpy as np

def nnt_with_ci(treated_events, treated_n, control_events, control_n, alpha=0.05):
    """Bender 2001 *CCT* 22:102 method; transforms RD CI to NNT CI handling singularity."""
    p_t = treated_events / treated_n
    p_c = control_events / control_n
    rd = p_c - p_t   # positive = treatment helps
    se_rd = np.sqrt(p_t * (1 - p_t) / treated_n + p_c * (1 - p_c) / control_n)
    z = 1.96 if alpha == 0.05 else None
    rd_ci = (rd - z * se_rd, rd + z * se_rd)

    nnt = 1 / rd if rd != 0 else float('inf')
    if rd_ci[0] > 0 and rd_ci[1] > 0:
        return f'NNTB {1/rd_ci[1]:.0f} to {1/rd_ci[0]:.0f}'
    elif rd_ci[0] < 0 and rd_ci[1] < 0:
        return f'NNTH {1/-rd_ci[1]:.0f} to {1/-rd_ci[0]:.0f}'
    else:
        # CI crosses zero -- Bender convention
        if rd > 0:
            return f'NNTB {nnt:.0f} (NNTB {1/rd_ci[1]:.0f} to inf to NNTH {1/-rd_ci[0]:.0f})'
        return f'NNTH {-nnt:.0f} (similar split)'
```

**Bender 2001 *Controlled Clinical Trials* 22:102-110** resolves the discontinuity at RD = 0: NNT has a singularity there, so a CI that crosses zero produces a disjoint NNT CI ("NNTB(some) -> infinity -> NNTH(some)"). The Cochrane/BMJ convention is to report exactly this -- the infinity in the middle signals non-significance and is more honest than truncating to one side.

**NNT from OR + baseline risk** (when only the OR is published):

```python
def nnt_from_or(odds_ratio, baseline_risk):
    baseline_odds = baseline_risk / (1 - baseline_risk)
    treatment_odds = baseline_odds * odds_ratio
    treatment_risk = treatment_odds / (1 + treatment_odds)
    arr = abs(baseline_risk - treatment_risk)
    return 1 / arr if arr > 0 else float('inf')
```

| OR | Baseline 5% | Baseline 20% | Baseline 50% |
|----|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0.5 | NNT=42 | NNT=12 | NNT=6 |
| 0.7 | NNT=70 | NNT=20 | NNT=12 |

**Always report baseline risk alongside NNT** -- the same OR produces dramatically different NNTs.

## Marginal RD via G-Computation -- The FDA 2023 Recipe

**Goal:** Compute the marginal RD (FDA 2023 primary estimand for binary endpoints) from a fitted logistic regression -- without requiring the analyst to switch model class.

**Approach:** Standardise over the observed covariate distribution. Predict per-subject probability under treatment=1 AND under treatment=0; take the mean of each; the difference is the marginal RD. SE via influence function or bootstrap.

```python
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Fit logistic with covariates
fit = smf.logit('y ~ z + x1 + x2 + x3', data=df).fit()

# Step 2: Predict under each treatment regime (counterfactual prediction)
df_z1 = df.assign(z=1)
df_z0 = df.assign(z=0)
p_z1 = fit.predict(df_z1)
p_z0 = fit.predict(df_z0)

# Step 3: Marginal estimates
marg_p1 = p_z1.mean()
marg_p0 = p_z0.mean()
marg_rd = marg_p1 - marg_p0          # FDA 2023 primary
marg_rr = marg_p1 / marg_p0
marg_or = (marg_p1 / (1 - marg_p1)) / (marg_p0 / (1 - marg_p0))

# Step 4: SE via bootstrap (or analytical influence function in R `marginaleffects`)
n_boot = 1000
boot_rds = np.zeros(n_boot)
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
for b in range(n_boot):
    idx = rng.choice(len(df), size=len(df), replace=True)
    fit_b = smf.logit('y ~ z + x1 + x2 + x3', data=df.iloc[idx]).fit(disp=0)
    p1_b = fit_b.predict(df_z1.iloc[idx]).mean()
    p0_b = fit_b.predict(df_z0.iloc[idx]).mean()
    boot_rds[b] = p1_b - p0_b

se_marg_rd = boot_rds.std(ddof=1)
ci_marg_rd = (marg_rd - 1.96*se_marg_rd, marg_rd + 1.96*se_marg_rd)
```

**R equivalent (preferred for confirmatory):**

```r
library(marginaleffects)
fit <- glm(y ~ z + x1 + x2 + x3, family = binomial, data = df)
avg_comparisons(fit, variables = 'z', vcov = 'HC3')
# Returns marginal RD with HC3 sandwich SE; CIs; deltamethod_inference
```

**Tsiatis et al 2008 robustness guarantee:** under randomisation Z ⊥ X, the g-computation marginal estimator is consistent for marginal ATE EVEN IF the outcome model is misspecified. Efficiency depends on model quality; consistency does not. This is why FDA 2023 accepts marginal RD via g-computation without requiring proof of correct logistic mean structure.

## Marginal vs Conditional Effects -- The Core ICH E9(R1) Question

For logistic regression, the maximum-likelihood coefficient on Z in `glm(Y ~ Z + X, family=binomial)` is the **conditional log odds ratio** -- the OR comparing Z=1 to Z=0 *holding X fixed*. Because the OR is non-collapsible, this is *different* from the marginal log OR even under perfect randomisation. Gail, Wieand & Piantadosi 1984 (*Biometrika* 71:431) first showed that treatment-effect estimates from nonlinear models are biased for the marginal effect when prognostic covariates are omitted, even under randomisation; this non-collapsibility is what FDA 2023 addresses by targeting a marginal estimand.

```python
# Conditional OR (the default; biased toward null vs marginal OR)
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import numpy as np

model = smf.logit('y ~ z + x1 + x2', data=df).fit()
cond_or = np.exp(model.params['z'])

# Marginal RD via g-computation / standardisation:
df_z1, df_z0 = df.assign(z=1), df.assign(z=0)
p_z1 = model.predict(df_z1).mean()
p_z0 = model.predict(df_z0).mean()
marg_rd = p_z1 - p_z0
marg_rr = p_z1 / p_z0
marg_or = (p_z1 / (1-p_z1)) / (p_z0 / (1-p_z0))

# Variance via influence function or bootstrap (RobinCar / marginaleffects)
# R: marginaleffects::avg_comparisons(model, variables='z', vcov='HC3')
```

**The reporting standard post-FDA-2023:** marginal estimand as primary (RD with HC3 sandwich SE), conditional as supportive. The two are different parameters, not different estimates of the same parameter. See clinical-biostatistics/logistic-regression for full g-computation machinery and Tsiatis et al 2008 *Stat Med* 27:4658.

### Non-collapsibility -- the standard explanation

A conditional (adjusted) OR typically differs from the marginal (unadjusted) OR even WITHOUT confounding. Conditioning on a prognostic covariate (one that predicts outcome but is unrelated to treatment) changes the OR by a mathematical property -- not bias. In most settings, the conditional OR is *further from the null* than the marginal OR. **This is what postdocs argue about:** Frank Harrell argues conditional effects are more clinically meaningful (they apply to individuals); FDA via Permutt argues marginal effects are what regulatory submissions need (the population-level decision). FDA 2023 settles it for regulatory reporting: marginal primary, conditional supportive.

**Risk ratios and risk differences are collapsible.** Marginal and conditional RR/RD are equal absent confounding. This is why FDA 2023 favours RD as the primary estimand for binary outcomes -- the conditional vs marginal distinction disappears.

## Reconciliation: When Methods Disagree

| Pattern | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Conditional OR (from adjusted logistic) > marginal OR (from g-computation) | Non-collapsibility (Permutt 2020); adjusted ORs further from null than marginal under most covariate structures | Report marginal RD as primary per FDA 2023; conditional OR as supportive with explicit parameter label |
| Wald CI excludes null but Wilson/Newcombe-Wilson CI overlaps null | Wald has poor coverage near 0 and 1 (Brown-Cai-DasGupta 2001) | Wilson for single proportion; Newcombe-Wilson hybrid or Miettinen-Nurminen for differences; cite as regulatory standard |
| Crude OR vs stratified MH-OR differ substantially | Confounding by stratification factor OR non-collapsibility OR effect modification | If RCT with stratified randomisation, use stratified analysis (Kahan-Morris 2012); if observational, investigate confounding via stratum-specific OR forest plot |
| OR vs RR direction agree but magnitudes differ greatly | Outcome prevalence > 10% (OR overstates RR at high baseline risk) | Use modified Poisson (Zou 2004) for direct RR estimation; report both for transparency |
| NNT from one trial vs another differs despite similar OR | Baseline risk differs across trials (NNT = 1/ARR depends on baseline) | Always report NNT alongside baseline risk; cite Bender 2001 *CCT* 22:102 for NNTB-inf-NNTH convention |
| Profile-likelihood CI differs from Wald CI in small-cell scenario | Hauck-Donner effect (Wald non-monotone near boundary; Yee 2022) | Use profile likelihood (R `MASS::confint.glm`); detect via `VGAM::hdeff()` |
| RMST difference and HR give different conclusions on treatment benefit | HR is time-averaged log-HR under PH violation; RMST captures cumulative benefit | Under PH violation, RMST is the more interpretable summary; see clinical-biostatistics/survival-analysis |

## Modified Poisson Regression for Common Outcomes

When prevalence > 10% and the policy quantity is RR (not OR), modified Poisson with sandwich SE directly estimates the RR (Zou 2004 *AJE* 159:702):

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import numpy as np

poisson_model = sm.GLM(df['outcome'],
                       sm.add_constant(df[['treatment', 'age']]),
                       family=sm.families.Poisson()).fit(cov_type='HC1')
rr_estimates = np.exp(poisson_model.params)
rr_ci = np.exp(poisson_model.conf_int())
```

`cov_type='HC1'` (Huber-White sandwich) corrects the over-dispersion that Poisson assumes; without it, SEs are wrong because binary data are NOT Poisson. Use HC3 (jackknife approximation) for n < 250 (Long-Ervin 2000 *Am Stat* 54:217). HC1 is the Stata default; HC3 is the R `sandwich` package default -- the difference can flip noninferiority p-values for n < 200.

## Forest Plots

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def forest_plot(labels, effects, lower_cis, upper_cis, ref_line=1.0, figsize=(8, 6), log_scale=True):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize)
    y_pos = range(len(labels))
    ax.errorbar(effects, y_pos,
                xerr=[np.array(effects) - np.array(lower_cis),
                      np.array(upper_cis) - np.array(effects)],
                fmt='D', color='black', capsize=3, markersize=5)
    ax.axvline(x=ref_line, color='gray', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.8)
    ax.set_yticks(list(y_pos))
    ax.set_yticklabels(labels)
    ax.set_xlabel('Effect estimate (95% CI)')
    if log_scale:
        ax.set_xscale('log')
    plt.tight_layout()
    return fig
```

Log scale ensures reciprocal effects (OR 0.5 and OR 2.0) appear equidistant from the null. For RD or RMST difference, use a linear scale.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Prevalence > 10% -> prefer RR over OR | Zhang-Yu 1998 *JAMA* 280:1690 | OR overstates RR materially; modified Poisson or log-binomial recovers RR directly |
| n > 100 per arm for Wald CI on log-OR | Brown-Cai-DasGupta 2001; Newcombe 1998a | Below this, Wald coverage is poor; profile likelihood or score-based preferred |
| HC1 (Stata default) vs HC3 (R default) for small n | Long-Ervin 2000 *Am Stat* 54:217 | HC3 (jackknife approximation) recommended for n <=250; difference can flip NI p-values |
| Marginal estimand for primary regulatory report | FDA 2023 Final Guidance | Marginal RD/RR/OR via g-computation; conditional OR is a different parameter (Permutt 2020) |
| Miettinen-Nurminen CI for RR/RD | Miettinen-Nurminen 1985; FDA/EMA NI margin practice | Regulatory standard; consistent with Pearson chi-square |
| Bender NNT convention | Bender 2001 *Controlled Clinical Trials* 22:102-110; Cochrane/BMJ style | When RD CI crosses zero, NNT CI is disjoint; report NNTB(lower) -> inf -> NNTH(upper) |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Adjusted OR much larger than unadjusted | Non-collapsibility, not confounding | Cite Permutt 2020; report both with explicit estimand labels (conditional vs marginal) |
| NNT reported as "NNT=25, CI 12 to -200" | Sign-confused output when RD CI crosses zero | Use Bender 2001 *CCT* 22:102 convention: "NNTB 25 (NNTB 12 to inf to NNTH 200)" |
| OR reported without baseline risk for clinical translation | Common in published papers | Always report event rates per arm alongside OR; provide NNT at observed baseline |
| `Table2x2` returns reciprocal OR | Column ordering puts outcome=0 first | Reorder: `crosstab[[1, 0]]` |
| Poisson SE much smaller than expected | Forgot `cov_type='HC1'` or 'HC3' | Always specify sandwich SE for modified Poisson; without it, SEs are wrong |
| Wald log-RR CI extends below 0 or implausibly | Katz log RR fails for small p | Switch to Miettinen-Nurminen or Koopman score; R `ratesci::scoreci(contrast='RR')` |
| Hauck-Donner: huge OR with non-significant Wald p | Wald non-monotonic near boundary | Use profile likelihood: R `MASS::confint.glm`; detect with `VGAM::hdeff()` |
| "Adjusted" model gives smaller effect than expected | Mediator adjustment | Check causal DAG; adjusting for mediators attenuates effect toward null |

## Anticipated Reviewer Pushback

| Pushback | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "Is the OR collapsible across the included covariates?" | No -- OR is non-collapsible. Cite Permutt 2020. Report marginal RD via g-computation as primary per FDA 2023. |
| "Why MN over Wald CI?" | Wald has poor coverage for sparse 2x2; MN matches Pearson chi-square test and is the FDA/EMA standard for NI margins. |
| "Hauck-Donner pathology check?" | For small cell counts: switch to profile likelihood CI (R `MASS::confint.glm`); cite Yee 2022 *JASA* 117:1763. |
| "Why HC3 over HC1?" | n <=250 favours HC3 per Long-Ervin 2000; HC1 (Stata) and HC3 (R sandwich) can disagree at small n. |
| "Where is the marginal effect?" | Per FDA 2023, marginal RD/RR via g-computation is the primary estimand for binary outcomes; conditional is supportive. |
| "Why NNT in 'NNTB-infinity-NNTH' notation?" | Bender 2001 *CCT* 22:102 convention; standard in BMJ/Lancet/Cochrane. Disjoint CI honestly conveys non-significance. |
| "Adjustment for stratification factors?" | Strata included in modified Poisson or in MN stratified CI via `ratesci::scoreci(stratified=TRUE)`; ignoring is over-conservative -- SE biased upward, power loss (Kahan-Morris 2012). |
| "What about effect modification across subgroups?" | Pooled estimate reported as primary; stratum-specific ORs in forest plot; Breslow-Day test for homogeneity; if heterogeneous, do not pool -- see clinical-biostatistics/subgroup-analysis. |
| "Post-hoc subgroup OR was significant -- can a claim be made?" | Not credible without pre-specification per EMA 2019 / CONSORT 2025; frame as hypothesis-generating; replicate in independent cohort before claiming. |
