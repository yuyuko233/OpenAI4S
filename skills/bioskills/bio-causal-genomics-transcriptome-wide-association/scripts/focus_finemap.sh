# FOCUS probabilistic gene-level fine-mapping of TWAS hits.
# Resolves co-significant gene clusters at gene-dense loci into a credible causal-gene set
# with per-gene posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs).

# ---- Inputs ----
GWAS_FILE='gwas.sumstats'                                # GWAS sumstats (CHR SNP BP A1 A2 Z P columns at minimum)
LD_REF_PREFIX='1000G_EUR/chr'                            # PLINK bfile per chromosome (chr1.bim/bed/fam, ...)
FOCUS_DB='focus_gtex_v8_whole_blood.db'                  # FOCUS DB matched to the TWAS weight panel
TISSUE='Whole_Blood'                                     # Tissue label inside the FOCUS DB

# Genome-wide significance threshold for SNPs that flag a locus for fine-mapping.
# 5e-8 is standard GWAS genome-wide significance; loci below this threshold trigger FOCUS.
P_THRESHOLD='5e-8'

OUT_PREFIX='gwas_focus_whole_blood'

# ---- Step 1: build FOCUS database from FUSION weights if not pre-built ----
# Skip this if using a pre-built FOCUS DB. Custom panels need this step.
# focus import gtex_whole_blood.pos fusion --tissue Whole_Blood --output focus_gtex_v8_whole_blood

# ---- Step 2: run FOCUS fine-mapping ----
# FOCUS takes the underlying GWAS sumstats (not the TWAS Z output) and internally:
#   1. computes per-gene TWAS Z using the panel weights
#   2. estimates the gene-by-gene predicted-expression correlation matrix as the LD analog
#   3. runs a Bayesian variable-selection model over genes (analog of variant fine-mapping)

# Single-ancestry bogdanlab/focus (pip pyfocus) omits --locations (uses default LD blocks)

# (with colon-separated per-ancestry sumstats/LD/weight DBs) are MA-FOCUS (mancusolab/ma-focus) syntax.

# ---- Step 3: filter credible-set genes ----
# FOCUS reports per-gene PIP. PIP >= 0.8 = causal candidate; 0.5 <= PIP < 0.8 = suggestive;
# PIP < 0.5 at a co-significant locus = LD-tagged co-regulated gene (NOT causal).

# ---- Step 4 (optional): MA-FOCUS for multi-ancestry ----
# Requires per-ancestry sumstats, per-ancestry LD references, and per-ancestry FOCUS DBs.
# Joint inference assumes a shared causal gene across ancestries; trans-ethnic
# gene-effect heterogeneity violates this and produces inflated heterogeneous-group probability.
#
# MA-FOCUS reuses the single-ancestry `focus finemap` CLI; multi-ancestry mode
# is signaled by colon-separated per-ancestry sumstats/LD/weight DBs plus
# paired ancestry codes in --locations.
