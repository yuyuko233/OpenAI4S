description: Quantifies protein abundance from mass spectrometry using label-free (LFQ/MaxLFQ, DIA fragment-level), isobaric (TMT/iTRAQ reporter ions, MS2 vs SPS-MS3), and metabolic (SILAC) approaches, including peptide-to-protein summarization (Tukey median polish, MaxLFQ, msqrob), sample-loading and IRS cross-plex normalization, and isotopic impurity correction. Use when turning peptide/PSM/reporter signal into a protein-by-sample abundance matrix for downstream analysis. Statistical testing of that matrix is differential-abundance; DIA quant mechanics and DIA-NN runs are dia-analysis; reading search-engine outputs is data-import; razor/shared-peptide group assignment is protein-inference.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: MSstats 4.10+, MSnbase 2.28+, iq 1.9+, numpy 1.26+, pandas 2.2+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Protein Quantification -- Reconstructing Protein Abundance from Ions Whose Physical Origin Dictates the Irreducible Error

**"Quantify proteins from my mass spec data"** -> Reconstruct a protein-by-sample abundance matrix from peptide/reporter ion signals, choosing a summarizer and normalizer that match where the signal physically came from -- because the measurement's physical origin sets an error that no normalization can remove.
- R: `MSstats::dataProcess()` (Tukey median polish summarization) for label-free feature-to-protein
- R: `iq::maxLFQ()` for the real MaxLFQ algorithm (delayed normalization + maximal peptide-ratio least-squares)
- R: `MSnbase::quantify(reporters=TMT10)` + `purityCorrect()` for isobaric reporter extraction
- R/Python: sample-loading + IRS scaling to bridge TMT plexes; per-sample median centering for LFQ

Scope: this skill OWNS converting peptide/PSM/reporter signal into a normalized protein abundance matrix (LFQ, TMT/iTRAQ, SILAC; summarization; normalization; IRS). Statistical testing of the matrix -> differential-abundance. DIA quant mechanics and DIA-NN execution -> dia-analysis. Parsing MaxQuant/DIA-NN outputs -> data-import. Razor/shared-peptide group assignment -> protein-inference. OUT OF SCOPE: missing-value imputation and the downshift false-positive trap (modeled in differential-abundance), and absolute copy-number calibration beyond a one-line pointer.

## The Single Most Important Modern Insight

1. **Every quant method answers "where does the signal physically come from?" differently, and that physical origin dictates the error structure no normalization can remove.** LFQ measures MS1 precursor area (or DIA fragment area) in SEPARATE runs -> the irreducible error is run-to-run variation plus stochastic, left-censored (MNAR) missingness. Isobaric TMT/iTRAQ measures low-m/z reporter ions from CO-ISOLATED, co-eluting peptides in ONE spectrum -> the irreducible error is RATIO COMPRESSION toward 1:1, a PHYSICAL co-isolation effect (interloper reporters add roughly equally to every channel), attacked at the instrument by SPS-MS3 and never fully undone in software. SILAC measures a heavy/light MS1 pair in the SAME scan -> lowest per-ratio variance, but its irreducible vulnerabilities are incomplete labeling and Arg->Pro label scrambling, which bias every ratio and cannot be corrected post hoc because channels are combined before any MS (a correctly mixed sample carries no inherent mixing error). Teach the signal origin and every threshold and failure mode below follows from it.

2. **The peptide-to-protein SUMMARIZATION choice is the highest-leverage decision in the pipeline, and it is invisible in the output.** In log space a peptide intensity is protein abundance + a peptide effect (ionization efficiency, flyability, missed cleavages, modifications) that spans orders of magnitude and is partly context-dependent, plus a run effect. Sum is dominated by the highest-flying peptide (dropout collapses it -> a fold change driven by detectability, not biology); mean is unbiased only if the detected peptide SET is identical across runs (it is not under MNAR); median discards relative-intensity information. Benchmarks confirm the quantification method is a dominant driver of which proteins are called differential (Lin 2022). Report the summarizer as prominently as the test, and run a sensitivity analysis across >=2 summarizers -- that is where the answer is most likely to move.

## Tool Taxonomy

| Tool / method | Citation | Mechanism / role | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| MaxLFQ | Cox 2014 | delayed normalization + maximal shared-peptide log-ratio least-squares; peptide scale cancels in pairwise ratios | label-free DDA/DIA relative quant across many samples |
| `iq::maxLFQ()` | Cox 2014 | R implementation of the real MaxLFQ; call it, do NOT reimplement | running MaxLFQ outside MaxQuant/DIA-NN |
| MSstats Tukey median polish | Choi 2014 | iteratively subtract peptide-medians + run-medians in log space; column effects = per-sample abundance; 50% breakdown | robust label-free default summarizer |
| msqrob (peptide-level) | Sticker 2020; Goeminne 2016 | treats the peptide effect as a covariate not noise; ridge + empirical Bayes + Huber | accuracy-critical small-n, unbalanced coverage (route OUT to differential-abundance) |
| iBAQ | -- | sum(peptide intensities) / number of theoretically observable tryptic peptides | rank / order-of-magnitude within-sample abundance |
| Top3 / Hi3 | Silva 2006 | sum/avg of top-3 peptide intensities, calibrate with one spiked standard | absolute amount, ~2 orders linear |
| Proteomic ruler | Wisniewski 2014 | histone signal as internal molar reference, no spike-in | absolute copies/cell without standards |
| Spectral counting / NSAF | Zybailov 2006 | count PSMs per protein, divide by protein LENGTH then total | largely OBSOLETE; niche AP-MS only |
| TMT/iTRAQ reporter | Ting 2011; McAlister 2014 | isobaric tag; reporter ratios at MS2 or SPS-MS3 | high multiplexing, zero run-to-run variation within a plex |
| SILAC | Ong 2002 | heavy/light precursor pair co-elute in the SAME MS1 scan | lowest-variance ratios, cell culture that can be labeled |
| DIA fragment-level | Demichev 2020 | MaxLFQ at the FRAGMENT level then roll up (route OUT to dia-analysis) | low-missingness label-free cohorts |

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Label-free DDA, MaxQuant evidence.txt | `MSstats::dataProcess` (TMP) | robust summarization with censored-value handling, the workhorse |
| Label-free, need MaxLFQ outside MaxQuant | `iq::maxLFQ()` | the real algorithm; median centering is NOT MaxLFQ |
| Label-free DIA matrix | -> dia-analysis | DIA-NN MaxLFQ at fragment level is owned there |
| TMT, accuracy critical | SPS-MS3 acquisition + reporter extraction | co-isolation rejected at the instrument; software cannot fully undo compression |
| TMT, single plex only | MS2 reporters + sample-loading normalization | within-plex ratios are stable |
| TMT, multiple plexes | sample-loading THEN IRS bridge (Plubell 2017) | absolute reporter intensities are NOT comparable across runs without a reference channel |
| SILAC ratios | verify labeling efficiency + Arg->Pro first | unchecked, both bias every ratio invisibly |
| Absolute copy number | proteomic ruler or Top3 + standard | iBAQ is within-sample rank only |
| AP-MS / affinity-enrichment pulldown | do NOT median/SL/IRS-normalize; control subtraction (SAINT/CompPASS/CRAPome) | an enrichment is not a balanced proteome; data-internal normalization erases the bait signal |
| Which summarizer? | run >=2 (TMP and MaxLFQ) and compare | this is the highest-leverage, invisible choice |

Default when uncertain: label-free DDA -> `MSstats::dataProcess` with `summaryMethod='TMP'`, `normalization='equalizeMedians'`; report the summarizer alongside results and sanity-check against `iq::maxLFQ()`.

## Label-Free Summarization and Normalization

### Summarize peptides to proteins with MSstats

**Goal:** Turn MaxQuant feature-level evidence into a normalized protein-level abundance matrix.

**Approach:** Reformat to MSstats input, then `dataProcess` applies median equalization and Tukey median polish (robust to outlier peptides, 50% breakdown) with censored-value handling for label-free missingness.

```r
library(MSstats)

maxquant_input <- MaxQtoMSstatsFormat(
    evidence = read.table('evidence.txt', sep = '\t', header = TRUE),
    proteinGroups = read.table('proteinGroups.txt', sep = '\t', header = TRUE),
    annotation = read.csv('annotation.csv')
)

# TMP = Tukey median polish; censoredInt='NA' treats missing intensities as left-censored
processed <- dataProcess(maxquant_input, normalization = 'equalizeMedians',
                         summaryMethod = 'TMP', censoredInt = 'NA', MBimpute = FALSE)

protein_abundance <- processed$ProteinLevelData
```

### Run the real MaxLFQ (not median centering)

**Goal:** Produce MaxLFQ protein intensities from a peptide quant matrix.

**Approach:** Call `iq::maxLFQ()`, which implements Cox 2014 delayed normalization and maximal peptide-ratio least-squares. Per-sample median centering shares only the name and silently gives a different answer.

```r
library(iq)

# rows = peptide ions, columns = samples, values = log2 intensities for ONE protein group
result <- maxLFQ(peptide_log2_matrix)
protein_estimate <- result$estimate    # one MaxLFQ value per sample
```

### Median-center label-free intensities (a normalizer, not a summarizer)

**Goal:** Correct per-sample loading differences before testing.

**Approach:** Subtract each sample's median log2 intensity (corrects LOCATION only; it cannot manufacture variance, so it is the safe default). Median centering normalizes; it does NOT summarize peptides to proteins.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

log_int = np.log2(intensities.replace(0, np.nan))    # MaxQuant writes 0 for missing; log2(0) = -inf
sample_medians = log_int.median(axis=0)
normalized = log_int - sample_medians + sample_medians.median()
```

## Isobaric (TMT/iTRAQ) Quantification

### Extract and impurity-correct reporter ions

**Goal:** Pull TMT reporter intensities from spectra and correct cross-channel isotope bleed.

**Approach:** Read spectra on disk, `quantify` the reporter region, then `purityCorrect` with a LOT-SPECIFIC impurity matrix from the reagent Certificate of Analysis. `readMSnSet` reads an already-quantified text matrix and does NOT extract reporters.

```r
library(MSnbase)

raw <- readMSData('experiment.mzML', mode = 'onDisk')
# method='max' for centroided spectra; reporters=TMT10 defines the 126-131 reporter m/z
quant <- quantify(raw, reporters = TMT10, method = 'max')

# makeImpuritiesMatrix has manufacturer-default templates; REPLACE with lot-specific Certificate values
imp <- makeImpuritiesMatrix(x = 10)
quant <- purityCorrect(quant, imp)
```

### Bridge multiple TMT plexes with IRS

**Goal:** Make reporter intensities comparable across separate TMT runs.

**Approach:** Absolute reporter intensities for the same protein differ 2-5x between plexes because each plex samples a random point on the elution profile. Sample-loading normalization fixes within-run loading; the Internal Reference Scaling bridge (Plubell 2017) then pins each plex's pooled reference channel to a common per-protein value. Order: SL, then IRS.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# protein_psm_sums: protein x channel, summed PSM reporter ions; one reference channel per plex
def sample_loading_normalize(plex):
    target = plex.sum(axis=0).mean()    # common target = mean column sum within the plex
    return plex * (target / plex.sum(axis=0))

def irs_scale(plexes, ref_cols):
    refs = pd.concat([p[ref] for p, ref in zip(plexes, ref_cols)], axis=1)
    geomean = np.exp(np.log(refs.replace(0, np.nan)).mean(axis=1))    # per-protein geometric mean of references
    out = []
    for p, ref in zip(plexes, ref_cols):
        factor = geomean / p[ref]    # per-protein per-plex scaling factor
        out.append(p.mul(factor, axis=0))
    return out
```

## SILAC Quantification

**Goal:** Compute heavy/light ratios while preserving on/off biology and flagging label artifacts.

**Approach:** A protein present only in the heavy channel is the interesting biology, not a NaN to discard. Verify labeling efficiency (>=95%, target 97-98%) on a heavy-only pilot and assess Arg->Pro conversion before trusting any ratio.

```python
import numpy as np

# Arg10/Lys8 is the common pairing (avoids overlap with the +6 isotope envelope)
SILAC_SHIFTS = {'Arg10': 10.008269, 'Lys8': 8.014199, 'Arg6': 6.020129, 'Lys6': 6.020129}

def silac_log2_ratio(heavy, light):
    if heavy > 0 and light > 0:
        return np.log2(heavy / light)
    if heavy > 0 and light == 0:
        return np.inf     # present only in heavy: real on/off biology, do NOT discard as NaN
    if light > 0 and heavy == 0:
        return -np.inf
    return np.nan
```

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### MaxLFQ reimplemented as median centering
**Trigger:** A homebrew function named `maxlfq` that only subtracts per-sample medians.
**Mechanism:** Real MaxLFQ is delayed normalization plus a maximal peptide-ratio least-squares solve; median centering shares only the name.
**Symptom:** Plausible-looking but systematically different intensities; unbalanced peptide sets handled wrongly.
**Fix:** Call `iq::maxLFQ()`, DIA-NN, or MaxQuant.

### TMT ratio compression
**Trigger:** MS2-only reporter quant on a complex sample.
**Mechanism:** Co-isolated interloper peptides add reporters roughly equally to every channel, pulling large true ratios toward 1:1; PHYSICAL, not removable by normalization.
**Symptom:** "Nothing is significant"; attenuated fold changes, inflated false negatives.
**Fix:** SPS-MS3 acquisition, narrower isolation windows, FAIMS/ion mobility, or complement-reporter methods; a PIF filter helps but MS1 purity underestimates true interference (Savitski 2013).

### TMT plexes concatenated without IRS
**Trigger:** Stacking reporter intensities from multiple plexes directly.
**Mechanism:** Absolute reporter intensities for one protein differ 2-5x across runs from random elution-profile sampling, unrelated to abundance.
**Symptom:** Plex appears as the dominant axis of variation; spurious cross-plex differences.
**Fix:** Include a pooled reference channel in EVERY plex; apply sample-loading then IRS (Plubell 2017).

### Isotopic impurity matrix mis-applied
**Trigger:** Using the default/example impurity matrix, the wrong lot, or a transposed/mis-ordered (127N vs 127C) matrix.
**Mechanism:** A few percent of each channel bleeds to +/-1 Da neighbors; wrong values mis-subtract, negative corrected intensities get clipped.
**Symptom:** Adjacent channels silently biased; extreme contrasts placed in adjacent channels confounded.
**Fix:** Use the lot-specific Certificate of Analysis values; randomize channel-to-condition assignment.

### SILAC Arg->Pro conversion / incomplete labeling
**Trigger:** Pro-containing peptides or a labeling efficiency below ~95%.
**Mechanism:** Cells convert heavy Arg to heavy Pro (+6 Da), splitting Pro-peptide signal and underestimating the heavy channel; residual light masquerades as down-regulation.
**Symptom:** Ratios biased toward light, worse for Pro-rich proteins; invisible without a check.
**Fix:** Proline supplementation, measure conversion per cell line, verify >=95% incorporation on a heavy-only pilot.

### SILAC on/off proteins discarded as NaN
**Trigger:** Returning NaN whenever either channel is zero.
**Mechanism:** A protein present only in heavy (or only light) is the interesting biology, thrown away.
**Symptom:** Largest true changes silently dropped before analysis.
**Fix:** Record present-in-one-channel cases as +/-Inf or flag them; route honest absence handling to differential-abundance.

### Spectral counting / NSAF used for fold changes
**Trigger:** Reaching for PSM counts for quantitative comparison.
**Mechanism:** Count statistics are catastrophic at low abundance and saturate; dynamic exclusion deliberately breaks count-abundance proportionality. NSAF divides intensity by protein LENGTH then total -- a count divided by total spectra is not NSAF.
**Symptom:** Noisy, biased estimates; the wrong normalization labeled NSAF.
**Fix:** Use MS1/MS2 intensity (LFQ/DIA); keep spectral counting as historical context only.

### AP-MS / enrichment pulldown normalized as a balanced proteome
**Trigger:** Median/sample-loading/IRS normalization applied to an affinity-purification or biotin-enrichment pulldown.
**Mechanism:** Data-internal normalization assumes most signal is an unchanging background; a successful pulldown is deliberately non-representative (bait plus a few interactors over background), so equalizing medians or loading rescales away the enrichment being measured.
**Symptom:** Real interactors flattened toward background; bait abundance dominates the axis of variation.
**Fix:** Do not data-internal-normalize an enrichment; score against negative-control pulldowns (SAINT/CompPASS/CRAPome) or normalize to bait abundance.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| MaxLFQ min. ratio count = 2 | Cox 2014 (default) | a single shared peptide gives a ratio with no outlier rejection; >=2 lets the median start rejecting interference; setting 1 admits unguarded single-peptide ratios |
| PIF >= 0.75 | community filter | rejects spectra with too much interloper signal; but MS1 purity UNDERESTIMATES true reporter interference (Savitski 2013), so PIF ~0.9 can still be compressed |
| TMT N/C reporter spacing = 6.3 mDa | Thompson 2019 | 13C-vs-15N mass defect; needs high-res MS2 (>=30-50k) to resolve N from C channels |
| Reporter match tolerance ~0.002-0.003 Da | -- | tight enough to separate 6.3 mDa N/C channels at high resolution |
| SILAC labeling efficiency >= 95% (target 97-98%) | -- | residual light contaminates the heavy channel -> false down-regulation; needs ~5-6 doublings |
| Min peptides per protein for quant >= 2 | -- | single-peptide (one-hit) proteins are quant-unreliable |
| Top3 uses exactly the top 3 peptides | Silva 2006 | most intense peptides are most reproducibly detected, closest to uniform per-mole response |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| `readMSnSet` does not extract reporters | it reads an already-quantified text matrix | use `readMSData(mode='onDisk')` then `quantify(reporters=TMT10, method='max')` |
| `log2(0) = -inf` in the matrix | MaxQuant writes 0 for "not quantified" | replace 0 -> NaN before any transform |
| Reading `Intensity` when ratios needed | `Intensity` is raw, not normalized; `iBAQ` is within-sample only | use `LFQ intensity` for between-sample LFQ ratios (see data-import) |
| Median centering called MaxLFQ | homebrew shares only the name | call `iq::maxLFQ()` / DIA-NN / MaxQuant |
| `MBimpute=TRUE` injects values silently | AFT imputation in `dataProcess` | set `MBimpute=FALSE`; model missingness in differential-abundance |
| Cross-plex TMT comparison is invalid | no reference channel / no IRS | add a pooled reference channel per plex, apply SL then IRS |
| MSnbase deprecation warnings | MSnbase is in maintenance mode | current pipelines use Spectra + QFeatures (`readQFeatures`, `aggregateFeatures`) |
