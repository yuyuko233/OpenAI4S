description: Decides how to preprocess plasma cfDNA sequencing data so the recoverable signal survives - library-prep-aware fragment expectations (dsDNA vs ssDNA/adaptase prep), UMI/duplex consensus with fgbio (ExtractUmisFromBam, GroupReadsByUmi --strategy paired for duplex, CallMolecularConsensusReads vs CallDuplexConsensusReads, FilterConsensusReads min-reads "total s1 s2"), the align->group->consensus->RE-align ordering, and the cfDNA dedup trap where naive coordinate dedup collapses nucleosome-coincident independent molecules. Covers when single-strand consensus suffices vs when duplex is mandatory, the singleton/sensitivity tax at low input, and reading the insert-size histogram as a pre-analytical QC instrument. Use when processing plasma cfDNA reads before fragmentomics, ctDNA mutation calling, or tumor-fraction estimation.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: bwa 0.7.17+, fgbio 2.1+, numpy 1.26+, pysam 0.22+, samtools 1.19+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures
- CLI: `<tool> --version` then `<tool> --help` to confirm flags

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

Notes specific to this skill: fgbio flag semantics drift across major versions - in `CallDuplexConsensusReads` the `--min-reads` is a permissive PRE-filter (fgbio issue #1009), and in `FilterConsensusReads` the `--min-reads` (`-M`) takes up to three values "total strand1 strand2" where if values two and three differ the more stringent value must come first. Confirm both against the installed `fgbio --help` before scripting.

# cfDNA Preprocessing

**"Preprocess my plasma cfDNA reads"** -> Convert reads to consensus molecules and an analysis-ready BAM without destroying the fragment-size signal or collapsing independent molecules.
- CLI: `fgbio ExtractUmisFromBam` -> `bwa mem -Y` -> `fgbio GroupReadsByUmi` -> `fgbio Call*ConsensusReads` -> RE-align -> `fgbio FilterConsensusReads`
- Python: shell the fgbio/bwa chain with `subprocess`; read insert sizes with `pysam` for QC

## The Single Most Important Modern Insight -- Pre-Analytics and Library Prep Set the Ceiling; Consensus Is Error Suppression, Not Just Dedup

What a cfDNA assay can ever see is fixed before any bioinformatics runs. cfDNA is not randomly sheared - it is a nucleosome footprint with a mononucleosome mode at ~167 bp and a ctDNA-enriched short tail (134-144 bp), so fragment length is structured biological signal, not noise to be normalized away. Two upstream choices determine what survives: (1) the blood draw and plasma prep (a delayed draw dumps leukocyte gDNA into the denominator and irreversibly dilutes tumor fraction - no algorithm recovers it; defer that QC to liquid-biopsy/analytical-validation), and (2) the library chemistry (dsDNA ligation polishes native ends and discards the sub-100 bp population; ssDNA/adaptase prep recovers short and damaged molecules). Reverse engineering a fragment the prep threw away, or a molecule a bad draw never delivered, is impossible.

The second reframe: UMI/duplex consensus is error suppression, not merely duplicate removal. Grouping reads by UMI and majority-voting a consensus erases PCR/sequencing errors that are not shared across a family - but a single-strand consensus votes unanimously for damage (C->T deamination, G->T 8-oxoG) that was on the template before amplification. Only DUPLEX consensus, requiring the same base on both independently-copied strands, removes those lesions. Single-strand consensus cannot. Choosing simplex vs duplex is choosing an error floor, and it trades against molecular recovery at low input (the singleton tax below).

## Library-Prep and Consensus Landscape

| Choice | What it does | Recoverable distribution / error floor |
|--------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| dsDNA ligation prep (NEB/KAPA-style) | needs duplex substrate; end-repair/A-tail polishes native ends | clean ~167 bp mode; sub-100 bp tail and native-end signal LOST |
| ssDNA prep, SRSLY/Kircher-Meyer lineage | denatures, ligates single strands; retains native ends + sawtooth | recovers short/nicked/damaged + sub-nucleosomal; prep for fragmentomics |
| ssDNA prep, adaptase/tail-based (Swift/Accel-1S) | single-strand but adaptase chemistry shifts apparent size | ~10 bp short of the canonical mode; sawtooth blunted (a chemistry signature, not a bug) |
| Single-strand UMI consensus (CallMolecularConsensusReads) | majority-vote one source strand's reads | removes PCR/sequencer error (~1e-4 to 1e-5); CANNOT remove deamination/oxidation damage |
| DUPLEX consensus (CallDuplexConsensusReads) | combine both-strand single-strand consensuses | error must occur identically on both strands to survive (~<1e-7); removes deamination/oxidation |

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Scenario | Recommended path | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Deep targeted panel with single-strand UMIs | adjacency group -> CallMolecularConsensusReads -> FilterConsensusReads | simplex consensus suppresses PCR/sequencer error to ~1e-4; the panel-VAF workhorse |
| Need VAF below ~0.1% / MRD-grade specificity | duplex prep -> `--strategy paired` -> CallDuplexConsensusReads -> filter `2 1 1` | duplex removes damage artifacts; reaches the ~1e-7 floor single-strand cannot |
| sWGS / ULP-WGS for tumor fraction | minimal processing: trim -> align -> light dedup; NO consensus | TF from copy number needs even coverage, not error suppression; defer to tumor-fraction-estimation |
| Degraded / low-input / FFPE-adjacent sample | ssDNA prep (SRSLY) to recover short+damaged molecules | dsDNA prep discards exactly the molecules a degraded sample has left |
| Fragmentomics / end-motif readout | ssDNA prep (native ends), NO in-silico size selection upstream | dsDNA fills jagged ends; size-selecting conditions on length and biases every feature |
| Picogram input, detection (not genotyping) | call permissively (`--min-reads 1`), accept singletons | requiring duplicate observation discards the only evidence for a low-VAF variant |
| No UMIs at all, quantitative readout | do NOT coordinate-dedup; document the bias (see Failure Modes) | nucleosome-positioned ends make naive dedup delete real molecules |

Methodology evolves: confirm current fgbio flag semantics and prep-vendor size behavior against live docs before committing a pipeline.

## The fgbio Consensus Pipeline

**Goal:** Turn UMI-tagged raw reads into error-suppressed consensus molecules with correct coordinates.

**Approach:** Extract UMIs into the `RX` tag, align (consensus needs coordinates to group), group by UMI + approximate position, call consensus (which emits UNMAPPED reads because the consensus sequence differs from any input read), RE-align the consensus, then apply the real quality gate with `FilterConsensusReads`. The two-pass alignment is mandatory.

```bash
# 1. Extract inline UMIs into RX. Read structure tokens: M=UMI, S=skip/stem, T=template, +=all remaining.
#    6M11S+T per end = 6 bp UMI, 11 bp stem (the S that bleeds into T if omitted), rest = insert.
fgbio ExtractUmisFromBam --input raw.unmapped.bam --output with_umis.bam \
    --read-structure 6M11S+T 6M11S+T --single-tag RX

# 2. Align. -Y soft-clips supplementaries so tag-bearing short-fragment sequence is not dropped.
bwa mem -t 8 -Y reference.fa with_umis.bam | samtools sort -o aligned.bam -
samtools index aligned.bam

# 3. Group by UMI. adjacency = simplex default; paired = MANDATORY for duplex (reconstructs strand pairing).
fgbio GroupReadsByUmi --input aligned.bam --output grouped.bam \
    --strategy paired --edits 1          # use --strategy adjacency for single-strand UMIs

# 4a. SIMPLEX: single-strand consensus, --min-reads takes ONE value.
fgbio CallMolecularConsensusReads --input grouped.bam --output consensus.unmapped.bam --min-reads 1

# 4b. DUPLEX: --min-reads here is a permissive PRE-filter (fgbio #1009) - call low, filter later.
fgbio CallDuplexConsensusReads --input grouped.bam --output consensus.unmapped.bam --min-reads 1

# 5. RE-align: consensus reads are emitted UNMAPPED by design. Re-map, then ZipperBams
#    transfers the consensus/UMI tags from the unmapped BAM onto the new alignments.
samtools fastq consensus.unmapped.bam | bwa mem -t 8 -Y -p reference.fa - \
  | fgbio ZipperBams --unmapped consensus.unmapped.bam --ref reference.fa \
  | samtools sort -o consensus.bam -

# 6. The REAL quality gate. --min-reads "total strand1 strand2"; "2 1 1" = true duplex (both strands seen).
#    If values two and three differ, the more stringent must come first (e.g. "6 3 0", not "0 3").
fgbio FilterConsensusReads --input consensus.bam --output filtered.bam --ref reference.fa \
    --min-reads 2 1 1 --max-read-error-rate 0.025 --max-base-error-rate 0.1 \
    --min-base-quality 40 --reverse-per-base-tags
```

Key flags: `--strategy paired` is non-negotiable for duplex (`adjacency` cannot reconstruct A/B strand pairing). `--min-reads 1 1 0` on the filter accepts single-strand consensus too (one strand may be absent); `2 1 1` requires both strands = true duplex. `--reverse-per-base-tags` makes per-base depth/error tags read in genomic orientation after alignment.

## Reading the Insert-Size Histogram (QC)

**Goal:** Use the fragment-length distribution as a pre-analytical instrument before trusting any downstream number.

**Approach:** Tabulate proper-pair template lengths from the BAM, locate the mode, and compare the shape against the expected nucleosome footprint - the mode, the sawtooth, and the long-fragment fraction each diagnose a specific failure.

```python
import pysam
import numpy as np

def insert_size_qc(bam_path, max_size=600):
    '''Summarize cfDNA fragment lengths as a QC readout.'''
    bam = pysam.AlignmentFile(bam_path, 'rb')
    sizes = [r.template_length for r in bam.fetch()
             if r.is_proper_pair and not r.is_secondary and 0 < r.template_length <= max_size]
    bam.close()
    sizes = np.array(sizes)
    long_frac = np.mean(sizes > 250)  # excess >250 bp signals gDNA/leukocyte-lysis contamination
    return {'n': len(sizes), 'mode_bp': int(np.bincount(sizes).argmax()),
            'median_bp': float(np.median(sizes)), 'frac_over_250bp': float(long_frac)}
```

A mode at ~167 bp with a ~10.4 bp sawtooth below it is healthy. A mode drifting up plus excess mass >250 bp is gDNA contamination. A mode ~10 bp low is the adaptase chemistry signature, not contamination. A ~120-130 bp spike is adapter dimer (trim adapters before reading the histogram).

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### The dedup trap (naive coordinate dedup on no-UMI cfDNA)
**Trigger:** running Picard MarkDuplicates / `samtools markdup` on cfDNA without UMIs. **Mechanism:** cfDNA ends pile up non-randomly at nucleosome/linker boundaries, so many independent molecules genuinely share the same ~167 bp start+end; coordinate dedup declares them PCR duplicates and keeps one. **Symptom:** deflated unique-molecule counts and depressed VAF for true low-frequency variants - worst exactly where coverage and nucleosome positioning are strongest. **Fix:** use UMIs and group by family; if none, do not dedup by position alone for quantitative readouts and document the bias. This is the strongest single argument for putting UMIs on a cfDNA assay.

### Strict filtering on the consensus caller instead of FilterConsensusReads
**Trigger:** setting `CallDuplexConsensusReads --min-reads` high. **Mechanism:** it is a PRE-filter (fgbio #1009) that discards data before the real filter sees it. **Symptom:** lower molecular recovery than expected with no specificity gain. **Fix:** call permissively (`--min-reads 1`), apply strictness in `FilterConsensusReads`.

### adjacency grouping on duplex data
**Trigger:** `--strategy adjacency` for a duplex library. **Mechanism:** adjacency cannot link the two strands of one duplex (which carry the UMI in opposite order). **Symptom:** duplex consensus finds no two-strand molecules; output collapses to simplex. **Fix:** `--strategy paired`.

### Blanket MAPQ filtering kills short ctDNA fragments
**Trigger:** a global `MAPQ >= 30/60` filter. **Mechanism:** a 40-80 bp insert has fewer anchoring bases and lands in the low-MAPQ tail even when correctly placed. **Symptom:** the short, ctDNA-enriched fragments are preferentially deleted - the molecules size-selection was meant to keep. **Fix:** filter MAPQ with the size distribution in mind; use a gentler threshold for fragmentomics.

### Reflexive `--min-reads >= 2` at low input (the singleton tax)
**Trigger:** requiring duplicate observation per family on a picogram-input library. **Mechanism:** a large fraction of unique cfDNA molecules are sequenced once (singletons); requiring two reads discards genuine, often the only, evidence for a variant. **Symptom:** sensitivity loss disguised as quality. **Fix:** for detection favor recovery (call permissively); reserve `2 1 1` for genotyping/MRD where error suppression dominates.

### Fragmentomics on a size-selected library
**Trigger:** computing end-motif/ratio/VAF features after in-vitro (Pippin) or in-silico size selection. **Mechanism:** selection conditions on length, so length-derived features are biased by construction. **Symptom:** distorted end-motif spectra and fragment-ratio features that do not reproduce. **Fix:** size-select for detection sensitivity only; never report length-derived features from a length-selected library; keep the selection step in metadata.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Mononucleosome mode 167 bp; ~10.4 bp sub-mode periodicity | Snyder 2016 *Cell* 164:57 | core particle (~147 bp) + linker; periodicity = helical pitch of nucleosome-bound DNA, a QC sanity check |
| TF/CTCF-footprint short fragments 35-80 bp | Snyder 2016 *Cell* 164:57 | sub-nucleosomal protection; only surfaces with ssDNA prep |
| ctDNA principal length 134-144 bp vs 167 bp germline | Underhill 2016 *PLoS Genet* 12:e1006162 | tumor fragments shorter; BRAF V600E mutant 132-145 bp vs WT 165 bp |
| ctDNA-enrichment selection windows 90-150 bp (and 250-320 bp) | Mouliere 2018 *Sci Transl Med* 10:eaat4921 | selecting the short window enriches mutant allele fraction at no extra sequencing cost |
| ssDNA prep mitochondrial / microbial cfDNA enrichment ~10.7x / ~71.3x | Burnham 2016 *Sci Rep* 6:27859 | dsDNA prep is blind to the ultrashort fraction these reside in |
| iDES error-suppression gain ~3x (barcode) x ~3x (in-silico) ~= ~15x | Newman 2016 *Nat Biotechnol* 34:547 | family-size and background polishing are complementary, not redundant |
| Duplex error floor <1 per 1e7 nt | Kennedy 2014 *Nat Protoc* 9:2586 | both-strand concordance requirement |
| FilterConsensusReads defaults: max-read-error 0.025, max-base-error 0.1, max-no-calls 0.2 | fgbio docs | per-read vs per-base vs fraction/count switch (<1.0 = fraction, >=1.0 = count) |
| gDNA-contamination signature: excess mass >180-250 bp / ladder distortion | Snyder 2016 (biology); pre-analytical QC | leukocyte-lysis gDNA is long; a "too clean, too long" library is contaminated, not pristine |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Consensus BAM has garbage coordinates | skipped re-alignment (consensus emitted unmapped) | RE-align consensus reads before FilterConsensusReads |
| UMI bases corrupt mapping / consensus | omitted the `S` skip in the read structure | include the stem: e.g. `6M11S+T` not `6M+T` |
| Duplex run finds no two-strand molecules | grouped with `--strategy adjacency` | regroup with `--strategy paired` |
| FilterConsensusReads rejects valid strand spec | `--min-reads 0 3` (less stringent first) | put the more stringent value first: `3 0` (or `6 3 0`) |
| Deflated VAF / low unique-molecule count | coordinate dedup on no-UMI cfDNA | use UMI families; never naive-dedup quantitative cfDNA |
| Short ctDNA fragments missing after filtering | blanket high MAPQ filter | lower MAPQ threshold; account for short-fragment mapping |
| Apparent ~10 bp size shift "needs correcting" | adaptase (Swift/Accel-1S) chemistry signature | record the prep; do not correct a real chemistry effect |
