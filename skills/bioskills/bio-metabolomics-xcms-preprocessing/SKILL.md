description: Programmatic untargeted LC-MS feature extraction in R with the modern xcms 4.x MsExperiment/XcmsExperiment API, taking raw mzML to a feature table via CentWave peak detection, retention-time alignment, peak-density correspondence, gap-filling, CAMERA redundancy collapse, and built-in QC feature filtering. Use when converting centroided LC-MS runs into a features-by-samples matrix and deciding centWave/grouping/alignment parameters. For drift correction and QC/CV filtering execution see metabolomics/normalization-qc; for metabolite identification see metabolomics/metabolite-annotation; for the MS-DIAL GUI alternative with MS2Dec deconvolution see metabolomics/msdial-preprocessing; for downstream statistics see metabolomics/statistical-analysis.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: xcms 4.x+ (MsExperiment/XcmsExperiment containers), Spectra 1.12+, CAMERA 1.58+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- R: `packageVersion('xcms')` then `?CentWaveParam` to verify parameter names and defaults

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

A feature table is only meaningful alongside its full processing specification: which xcms version, every `*Param` value, and the fill/filter ordering. The table is a parameterized hypothesis about which molecules exist, not the data.

# XCMS Untargeted LC-MS Preprocessing

**"Turn my raw LC-MS files into a feature table"** -> Detect chromatographic peaks per file, align retention times across runs, group corresponding peaks into features, fill gaps, then collapse adduct/isotope redundancy.
- R: `readMsExperiment()` -> `findChromPeaks()` -> `adjustRtime()` -> `groupChromPeaks()` -> `fillChromPeaks()` (xcms)

## The Single Most Important Insight -- The Feature Table Is a Model-Dependent Artifact, Not Ground Truth

Every cell in the table is the output of a detection + grouping + filling model with chosen parameters. Two analysts with different centWave/grouping settings produce materially different tables from identical raw files, so "not detected" is a statement about the parameters, not the sample. Three consequences reorganize the whole workflow: (1) preprocessing parameters silently set the detection floor - a compound absent from results may be present in the raw data but excluded by `noise`/`prefilter`/`peakwidth`/`snthresh`; (2) `fillChromPeaks` integrates whatever signal sits in a feature window even when no peak exists, fabricating a positive number where the honest answer is "below detection"; (3) one compound yields 5-15 features (adducts, isotopologues, in-source fragments, multimers), so a 10,000-feature table is plausibly ~1,000 compounds (Mahieu 2017). Report parameters as part of the result, inspect EICs and alignment of every hit, and collapse redundancy before annotation.

## API Generations -- Use Modern, Not Legacy

| Path | Containers | Verbs | Status |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Modern (xcms 4.x) | `MsExperiment` (raw, Spectra backend) / `XcmsExperiment` (result) | `findChromPeaks` / `adjustRtime` / `groupChromPeaks` / `fillChromPeaks` driven by `*Param` objects | Preferred |
| Legacy (xcms <3) | `xcmsSet` / `xcmsRaw` | `findPeaks` / `group` / `retcor` / `fillPeaks`; `readMSData(mode='onDisk')` | Deprecated - do not use in new code |

Parameters are objects, not loose args: `findChromPeaks(data, param = CentWaveParam(...))`, never `findChromPeaks(data, ppm=..., peakwidth=...)`.

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Situation | Do | Why |
|-----------|----|----|
| High-res centroid (Orbitrap, Q-Exactive, qTOF) | `CentWaveParam` | Wavelet on real mass traces, no fixed binning |
| Low-res / quadrupole / profile-only | `MatchedFilterParam` | Model-peak on binned EICs tolerates poor resolution |
| Profile data of any kind | Centroid first (msconvert vendor peakPicking, or `Spectra::pickPeaks`) | centWave requires centroids; profile input yields garbage mass traces |
| Many shared, well-behaved peaks across samples | `PeakGroupsParam` (after an initial `groupChromPeaks`) | Loess on universal anchor peaks; gentle and fast |
| Few shared peaks / sparse / strong nonlinear drift | `ObiwarpParam` | Full-profile warping needs no prior peaks |
| Cohort with large case/control compositional differences | `ObiwarpParam`, or `PeakGroupsParam` with `subset =` QC indices | Few universal anchors mis-register the condition-specific metabolome |
| New instrument, no parameter priors | AutoTuner / IPO for a starting neighborhood, then verify against EIC FWHM | Optimizers maximize a surrogate, not biology (McLean 2020) |
| GC-EI data | Deconvolution tools, not xcms peak picking -> metabolomics/msdial-preprocessing | Co-elution + universal fragmentation require component separation first |

## Peak Detection

**Goal:** Detect chromatographic peaks in each centroided file.

**Approach:** Build a `CentWaveParam` with `ppm` and `peakwidth` set from the actual instrument and chromatography (see Quantitative Thresholds), then call `findChromPeaks`.

```r
library(xcms)
# spectraFiles: centroided mzML paths; pd: data.frame with one row per file
raw <- readMsExperiment(spectraFiles = mzml_files, sampleData = pd)

# ppm is across-scan centroid scatter (~2-3x measured error), NOT the spec mass accuracy.
# peakwidth is c(min, max) in SECONDS, measured from EIC base-widths of known peaks.
cwp <- CentWaveParam(ppm = 10, peakwidth = c(2, 20), snthresh = 10,
                     prefilter = c(3, 1000), noise = 1000, mzdiff = -0.001,
                     integrate = 1L, mzCenterFun = 'wMean')
xdata <- findChromPeaks(raw, param = cwp)
nrow(chromPeaks(xdata))
```

## Retention-Time Alignment

**Goal:** Remove cross-run RT drift so the same compound lands at the same RT in every sample.

**Approach:** Choose obiwarp (no prior peaks) or peakGroups (anchor-based); align to a pooled QC, never to file #1. Regroup afterward because RTs changed.

```r
# obiwarp: full-profile warping. binSize here is the m/z profile bin (default 1),
# distinct from PeakDensityParam$binSize and MatchedFilterParam$binSize.
xdata <- adjustRtime(xdata, param = ObiwarpParam(binSize = 0.6))

# peakGroups alternative needs an initial correspondence and good universal anchors:
# xdata <- groupChromPeaks(xdata, param = pdp_anchor)
# xdata <- adjustRtime(xdata, param = PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 0.85, span = 0.4,
#     subset = which(sampleData(xdata)$sample_type == 'QC'), subsetAdjust = 'average'))
plotAdjustedRtime(xdata)
```

## Correspondence (Grouping)

**Goal:** Match peaks across samples into consensus features.

**Approach:** Peak-density grouping in m/z slices; `bw` is the dominant knob and must reflect residual post-alignment RT scatter, not raw peak width.

```r
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = sampleData(xdata)$sample_group,
                        bw = 5, minFraction = 0.5, minSamples = 1, binSize = 0.025)
xdata <- groupChromPeaks(xdata, param = pdp)
nrow(featureDefinitions(xdata))
```

## Gap-Filling

**Goal:** Integrate signal for features missing a detected peak in some samples.

**Approach:** `fillChromPeaks` with `ChromPeakAreaParam`; treat filled values as imputations, not measurements.

```r
xdata <- fillChromPeaks(xdata, param = ChromPeakAreaParam())
filled <- chromPeakData(xdata)$is_filled   # logical flag; lives in chromPeakData, not chromPeaks
feat <- featureValues(xdata, value = 'into')        # features x samples matrix
defs <- featureDefinitions(xdata)                   # mzmed / rtmed / npeaks per feature
```

## Redundancy Collapse

**Goal:** Group the same compound's adducts/isotopes/fragments back toward compound spectra before annotation.

**Approach:** CAMERA in order groupFWHM -> groupCorr -> findIsotopes -> findAdducts (isotopes before adducts). Correlation grouping needs enough samples to be meaningful and can over- or under-merge - verify against the table size.

```r
library(CAMERA)
xsa <- xsAnnotate(as(xdata, 'xcmsSet'))
xsa <- groupFWHM(xsa, perfwhm = 0.6)
xsa <- groupCorr(xsa)
xsa <- findIsotopes(xsa, mzabs = 0.01, ppm = 10)
xsa <- findAdducts(xsa, polarity = 'positive')
peaklist <- getPeaklist(xsa)
```

## QC Feature Filtering (Preprocessing/QC Bridge)

**Goal:** Drop features that fail conventional QC, operationalizing Broadhurst 2018 inside the xcms object.

**Approach:** `filterFeatures` with `RsdFilter` (CV in QCs), `DratioFilter` (sd_QC/sd_sample), `PercentMissingFilter`, `BlankFlag`. Drift correction and the full QC pipeline live in metabolomics/normalization-qc.

```r
qc <- sampleData(xdata)$sample_group == 'QC'
study <- sampleData(xdata)$sample_group %in% c('Control', 'Treatment')
xdata <- filterFeatures(xdata, filter = RsdFilter(threshold = 0.3, qcIndex = qc))
xdata <- filterFeatures(xdata, filter = DratioFilter(threshold = 0.5, qcIndex = qc, studyIndex = study))
```

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### ppm set to the spec sheet
- **Trigger:** Setting `ppm = 3` because the Orbitrap datasheet says 3 ppm.
- **Mechanism:** centWave `ppm` is across-scan centroid scatter, which exceeds time-averaged mass accuracy; too tight fragments one ion into short ROIs that each fail `prefilter`.
- **Symptom:** Features vanish entirely (not degrade); the better the instrument spec, the worse it looks.
- **Fix:** Set `ppm` to ~2-3x the empirical per-scan centroid scatter, not the datasheet number.

### peakwidth mismatch
- **Trigger:** Copying the default `c(20, 50)` onto modern UHPLC.
- **Mechanism:** Lower bound too high discards sharp 2-5 s peaks; upper bound too low clips broad HILIC/tailing peaks. No warning is emitted.
- **Symptom:** Real peaks silently absent from the table.
- **Fix:** Measure base-width FWHM from 5-10 known EICs; set `peakwidth ~ c(0.5x min, 2x max)`.

### prefilter/noise/snthresh as the trace guillotine
- **Trigger:** Tuning `snthresh` while `prefilter[I]` already kills the trace.
- **Mechanism:** These are three serial gates on the same low-intensity signal; the lowest wins. On high-baseline instruments the default `I=100` may both under-filter noise and kill trace metabolites.
- **Symptom:** Trace metabolites never appear regardless of `snthresh`.
- **Fix:** Lower `prefilter[I]` first for trace work; the lowest gate dominates.

### bw too coarse / alignment-coupled
- **Trigger:** Copying `bw = 30` onto UHPLC, or choosing `bw` independently of alignment quality.
- **Mechanism:** On UHPLC, `bw=30` merges chromatographically resolved co-eluting compounds; with poor alignment a tight `bw` instead splits one compound across features.
- **Symptom:** Averaged-away differences (over-merge) or duplicate split features (under-merge).
- **Fix:** Set `bw` from residual post-alignment RT scatter (often 2-6 s on UHPLC); inspect EICs of merged/split features.

### gap-filling fabricates intensities
- **Trigger:** Feeding a naively filled table straight into a t-test.
- **Mechanism:** Missingness is MNAR (below LOD); filling integrates the noise floor into a positive number, inflating the absent group's mean and shrinking the fold-change being tested.
- **Symptom:** "Significant" features that are mostly filled in one group.
- **Fix:** Track `is_filled`; report per-feature filled fraction; for inference use unfilled values with MNAR-aware imputation (QRILC/GSimp), reserving the fill for dense exploratory PCA.

### skipping redundancy collapse
- **Trigger:** Treating feature count as compound count.
- **Mechanism:** One compound makes 5-15 features (~90% of features are degenerate, Mahieu 2017); correlated adduct "hits" multiply the multiple-testing burden.
- **Symptom:** Inflated dimensionality; clusters of co-significant features that are one molecule.
- **Fix:** Run CAMERA/RAMClustR before annotation; treat collapse as a tunable false-merge/false-split tradeoff with no ground truth.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `ppm` Orbitrap/Q-Exactive 5-10, qTOF 15-30 | Tautenhahn 2008; instrument physics | ~2-3x measured across-scan centroid scatter, not spec accuracy |
| `peakwidth` UHPLC c(2,20), HPLC c(10,40), HILIC c(10,60) (s) | Smith 2006; chromatography | Must bracket measured EIC base-widths; default c(20,50) wrong for UHPLC |
| Points across peak >= ~6-7 | Zeng 2023 *JASMS* 34:1136 | Below this, peak-area precision degrades non-linearly; an acquisition limit no parameter recovers |
| `prefilter = c(3, I)` | Tautenhahn 2008 | Min 3 consecutive scans above intensity I; I set per instrument baseline |
| Grouping `bw` 2-6 s (UHPLC) | xcms vignette | Default 30 s merges resolved co-eluting compounds on fast chromatography |
| QC CV (RSD) < 0.20-0.30 | Broadhurst 2018 *Metabolomics* 14:72 | Features with high QC variance are unreliable |
| D-ratio < 0.5 | Broadhurst 2018 | Technical variance must sit well below biological |
| Blank flag k ~ 3-5 | Broadhurst 2018 | Test-sample mean must exceed k x blank mean |
| ~1 compound per 5-15 features | Mahieu 2017 *Anal Chem* 89:10397 | ~90% of detected features are adduct/isotope/fragment degeneracy |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| `could not find function "readMSData"` or legacy verbs missing | Using deprecated `xcmsSet`/`readMSData` API on xcms 4.x | Use `readMsExperiment()` + the `findChromPeaks`/`groupChromPeaks` verbs |
| `unused argument (ppm = ...)` in findChromPeaks | Passing loose args instead of a `*Param` object | Wrap in `CentWaveParam(...)` and pass via `param =` |
| Features defined on uncorrected RT | Skipped the regroup after `adjustRtime` | Call `groupChromPeaks` again after alignment |
| Garbage mass traces, almost no peaks | Profile (non-centroid) data fed to centWave | Centroid first (msconvert vendor peakPicking or `Spectra::pickPeaks`) |
| `sampleGroups` length/semantics error | Vector misaligned with sample order or missing | Pass `sampleData(xdata)$group` matching file order; it is mandatory |
| Three different `binSize` defaults confused | obiwarp (m/z, default 1) vs PeakDensity (m/z, 0.25) vs matchedFilter (m/z, 0.1) | Set each in its own `*Param`; they are not the same knob |
| `as(xdata, 'xcmsSet')` fails or warns | CAMERA expects the legacy container | Coerce the `XcmsExperiment` to `xcmsSet` only for CAMERA; keep modern objects upstream |
