## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: BioPython 1.83+, numpy 1.26+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# MSA Parsing and Analysis

Parse multiple sequence alignments to extract information, analyze content, and prepare for downstream analysis.

## Required Import

**Goal:** Load modules for parsing, analyzing, and manipulating multiple sequence alignments.

**Approach:** Import AlignIO for reading, Counter for column analysis, and alignment classes for constructing modified alignments.

```python
from Bio import AlignIO
from Bio.Align import MultipleSeqAlignment
from Bio.SeqRecord import SeqRecord
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from collections import Counter
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

Optional for streaming and Easel-based weighting:
```python
import pyhmmer
```

## Loading Alignments

**Goal:** Read an MSA file and inspect its dimensions.

**Approach:** Use `AlignIO.read()` specifying the file and format.

```python
from Bio import AlignIO

alignment = AlignIO.read('alignment.fasta', 'fasta')
print(f'{len(alignment)} sequences, {alignment.get_alignment_length()} columns')
```

## Extracting Sequence Information

### Get All Sequence IDs
```python
seq_ids = [record.id for record in alignment]
```

### Get Sequences as Strings
```python
sequences = [str(record.seq) for record in alignment]
```

### Get Sequence by ID
```python
def get_sequence_by_id(alignment, seq_id):
    for record in alignment:
        if record.id == seq_id:
            return record
    return None

target = get_sequence_by_id(alignment, 'species_A')
```

### Access Descriptions and Annotations
```python
for record in alignment:
    print(f'ID: {record.id}')
    print(f'Description: {record.description}')
    print(f'Annotations: {record.annotations}')
```

## Column-wise Analysis

**Goal:** Analyze alignment content column by column to assess composition, conservation, and variability.

**Approach:** Use column indexing (`alignment[:, idx]`) and Counter to examine character frequencies at each position.

### Get Single Column
```python
column_5 = alignment[:, 5]  # Returns string of characters at position 5
print(column_5)  # e.g., 'AAAGA'
```

**API note:** `Bio.AlignIO` returns `MultipleSeqAlignment` objects whose `[:, idx]` returns a plain `str`; `[:, start:end]` returns another `MultipleSeqAlignment`. The newer `Bio.Align.Alignment` (from `Align.read` / `Align.parse`) uses numpy-backed slicing -- verify with `type(alignment[:, 0])` before assuming string methods work. For numpy-array access to the full alignment, use `np.array(alignment)`.

### Iterate and Count Columns
```python
for col_idx in range(alignment.get_alignment_length()):
    column = alignment[:, col_idx]
    counts = Counter(column)
```

### Find Conserved Positions
```python
def find_conserved_positions(alignment, threshold=1.0):
    conserved = []
    for col_idx in range(alignment.get_alignment_length()):
        column = alignment[:, col_idx]
        counts = Counter(column)
        most_common_char, most_common_count = counts.most_common(1)[0]
        if most_common_char != '-':
            conservation = most_common_count / len(alignment)
            if conservation >= threshold:
                conserved.append((col_idx, most_common_char))
    return conserved

fully_conserved = find_conserved_positions(alignment, threshold=1.0)
mostly_conserved = find_conserved_positions(alignment, threshold=0.8)
```

## Gap Analysis

**Goal:** Quantify gap distribution across sequences and columns to identify problematic regions or sequences.

**Approach:** Count gap characters per sequence and per column, then identify positions exceeding a gap fraction threshold.

### Count Gaps Per Sequence
```python
gap_counts = [(record.id, str(record.seq).count('-')) for record in alignment]
for seq_id, gaps in gap_counts:
    print(f'{seq_id}: {gaps} gaps')
```

### Count Gaps Per Column
```python
def gaps_per_column(alignment):
    return [alignment[:, i].count('-') for i in range(alignment.get_alignment_length())]

gap_profile = gaps_per_column(alignment)
```

### Find Gappy Columns
```python
def find_gappy_columns(alignment, threshold=0.5):
    gappy = []
    num_seqs = len(alignment)
    for col_idx in range(alignment.get_alignment_length()):
        column = alignment[:, col_idx]
        gap_fraction = column.count('-') / num_seqs
        if gap_fraction >= threshold:
            gappy.append(col_idx)
    return gappy

columns_to_remove = find_gappy_columns(alignment, threshold=0.5)
```

### Remove Gappy Columns
```python
def remove_gappy_columns(alignment, threshold=0.5):
    num_seqs = len(alignment)
    keep_columns = []
    for col_idx in range(alignment.get_alignment_length()):
        column = alignment[:, col_idx]
        gap_fraction = column.count('-') / num_seqs
        if gap_fraction < threshold:
            keep_columns.append(col_idx)

    new_records = []
    for record in alignment:
        new_seq = ''.join(str(record.seq)[i] for i in keep_columns)
        new_records.append(SeqRecord(Seq(new_seq), id=record.id, description=record.description))
    return MultipleSeqAlignment(new_records)

cleaned = remove_gappy_columns(alignment, threshold=0.5)
```

## Alignment Trimming

Trimming controversy and tool selection (ClipKIT, trimAl, BMGE, Divvier, HMMcleaner, Noisy) is the subject of a dedicated skill. Use this short decision matrix for routing:

| Goal | First-line tool |
|------|-----------------|
| Phylogenetic-tree input | ClipKIT `kpic-smart-gap` (Steenwyk et al 2020 PLOS Bio) |
| HMM profile building | trimAl `-gappyout` (Capella-Gutierrez et al 2009 Bioinf) |
| Selection / dN/dS input | Avoid aggressive trimming; use TCS / GUIDANCE2 column masking |
| Deep prokaryotic phylogenomics | BMGE (Criscuolo & Gribaldo 2010 BMC Evol Biol) |
| Preserve column-mapping for residue-level analysis | trimAl `-colnumbering` |

See alignment/alignment-trimming for full mode comparisons, decision trees, and runnable examples.

## Gap Handling for Phylogenetics

How gaps are treated in downstream phylogenetic analysis significantly affects tree topology:

| Treatment | Method | Tradeoff |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Missing data (default) | Gaps = unknown character | Most common; can be statistically inconsistent under ML |
| Fifth state | Gap = 5th nucleotide | Biologically problematic (gaps of different lengths treated equally) |
| Simple indel coding | Each unique indel coded as binary character | Most biologically realistic; adds phylogenetic signal |

For slow- to mid-rate datasets where indels are phylogenetically informative, prefer SIC indel coding or fifth-state treatment; for rapidly-evolving datasets (intra-species, ITS regions, retroelement-rich plant genomes), default to missing-data treatment because gap homology is unreliable. Run a sensitivity analysis comparing both treatments before drawing topological conclusions.

## Identifying Unreliable Alignment Regions

Columns exhibiting **both** high gap fraction AND low conservation are the strongest indicators of alignment uncertainty. These often reflect guide tree artifacts rather than true evolutionary events. Before phylogenetic analysis:

1. Flag columns with gap fraction >50%, which may be alignment artifacts
2. Check if gappy regions coincide with insertions in a single divergent sequence (remove that sequence and re-align)
3. For critical analyses, run GUIDANCE2 or MUSCLE5 ensemble to get per-column confidence scores; mask columns below the reliability threshold (default: 0.93 for GUIDANCE2)

## Consensus Sequence

**"Get consensus sequence"** -> Derive a single representative sequence from an MSA based on majority-rule voting at each column.

**Goal:** Generate a consensus sequence from the alignment using a frequency threshold.

**Approach:** At each column, select the most common non-gap character if it exceeds the threshold; otherwise mark as ambiguous.

### Simple Majority Consensus
```python
def consensus_sequence(alignment, threshold=0.5, gap_char='-', ambiguous='N'):
    consensus = []
    for col_idx in range(alignment.get_alignment_length()):
        column = alignment[:, col_idx]
        counts = Counter(column)
        most_common_char, most_common_count = counts.most_common(1)[0]
        if most_common_char == gap_char:
            counts.pop(gap_char, None)
            if counts:
                most_common_char, most_common_count = counts.most_common(1)[0]
            else:
                most_common_char = gap_char

        if most_common_count / len(alignment) >= threshold:
            consensus.append(most_common_char)
        else:
            consensus.append(ambiguous)
    return ''.join(consensus)

consensus = consensus_sequence(alignment, threshold=0.5)
```

### Note on Bio.Align.AlignInfo
The `AlignInfo.SummaryInfo` class is deprecated in recent Biopython versions. The custom `consensus_sequence()` function above is the recommended approach. When deprecation warnings appear from `AlignInfo`, callers should switch to the custom implementation.

## Extracting Regions

### Slice by Column Range
```python
region = alignment[:, 100:200]  # Columns 100-199
```

### Slice by Sequence Range
```python
subset = alignment[0:10]  # First 10 sequences
```

### Extract Ungapped Regions from Reference
```python
def extract_ungapped_regions(alignment, ref_idx=0):
    ref_seq = str(alignment[ref_idx].seq)
    ungapped_cols = [i for i, char in enumerate(ref_seq) if char != '-']

    new_records = []
    for record in alignment:
        new_seq = ''.join(str(record.seq)[i] for i in ungapped_cols)
        new_records.append(SeqRecord(Seq(new_seq), id=record.id, description=record.description))
    return MultipleSeqAlignment(new_records)

ungapped = extract_ungapped_regions(alignment, ref_idx=0)
```

## Sequence Filtering

**Goal:** Subset an alignment to retain only sequences matching specific criteria (ID pattern, gap content, uniqueness).

**Approach:** Iterate over alignment records, apply filter conditions, and reconstruct a new MultipleSeqAlignment from matching records.

```python
import re

def filter_by_id(alignment, pattern):
    regex = re.compile(pattern)
    return MultipleSeqAlignment([r for r in alignment if regex.search(r.id)])

def filter_by_gap_content(alignment, max_gap_fraction=0.1):
    return MultipleSeqAlignment(
        [r for r in alignment if str(r.seq).count('-') / len(r.seq) <= max_gap_fraction]
    )

def remove_duplicates(alignment):
    seen = set()
    return MultipleSeqAlignment([r for r in alignment if not (str(r.seq) in seen or seen.add(str(r.seq)))])
```

## Working with Annotations

Stockholm-derived alignments expose secondary-structure markup, per-column GC/GR annotations, and per-sequence metadata via `record.annotations`, `record.letter_annotations`, and `alignment.column_annotations`. See usage-guide.md "Working with Annotations" for the full access pattern.

## Position Mapping

**Goal:** Convert between alignment column coordinates and ungapped sequence coordinates.

**Approach:** For one-off lookups, walk the sequence tracking gap characters. For repeated queries on the same sequence, vectorize with `numpy.cumsum` over a gap-mask -- O(L) preprocessing, O(1) lookups.

### Vectorized Coordinate Mapping (Recommended)

```python
import numpy as np

def coordinate_map(record):
    chars = np.frombuffer(str(record.seq).encode('ascii'), dtype=np.uint8)
    is_residue = chars != ord('-')
    seq_to_aln = np.flatnonzero(is_residue)
    aln_to_seq = np.where(is_residue, np.cumsum(is_residue) - 1, -1)
    return seq_to_aln, aln_to_seq

seq_to_aln, aln_to_seq = coordinate_map(alignment[0])
column_for_residue_42 = seq_to_aln[42]
residue_at_column_100 = aln_to_seq[100]
```

`aln_to_seq[i] == -1` indicates a gap at alignment column `i`. This pattern handles 1 M-site genomic alignments in milliseconds compared to the loop-based version's seconds.

For single lookups without numpy, walk the sequence tracking a counter (`seq_pos += 1` for each non-`-` char). The vectorized form above subsumes both directions.

### Mapping Alignment Columns to PDB Residues

A column-to-PDB mapping requires THREE coordinate systems: alignment column -> SEQRES residue (ungapped FASTA) -> ATOM residue (resolved structure). The SEQRES-to-ATOM map is non-trivial because PDB structures have unmodelled loops, N-terminal tags, engineered mutations, and seleno-substitutions. Conservation scores mapped via the bare alignment-to-SEQRES path will be off-by-many residues whenever the structure has missing density. For SEQRES/ATOM extraction and the authoritative `_pdbx_poly_seq_scheme` mapping, see `structural-biology/structure-navigation`.

## Sequence Weighting and Neff

Compute sequence weights before any column-wise statistic on phylogenetically structured datasets (lots of closely-related sequences plus a few outliers); without weighting, every per-column metric is biased toward the over-represented clades.

### Henikoff Sequence Weights

**Goal:** Give each sequence a weight that reflects its non-redundant contribution.

**Approach:** Each column `c` contributes `1 / (k_c * n_{s,c})` to sequence `s`, where `k_c` is the number of distinct residues at column `c` and `n_{s,c}` is the count of `s`'s residue at that column (Henikoff & Henikoff 1994 JMB).

```python
def henikoff_weights(alignment):
    seq_array = np.array([list(str(r.seq)) for r in alignment])
    weights = np.zeros(len(alignment))
    for col_idx in range(seq_array.shape[1]):
        residues, inverse, counts = np.unique(seq_array[:, col_idx], return_inverse=True, return_counts=True)
        if '-' in residues:
            continue
        weights += 1.0 / (len(residues) * counts[inverse])
    return weights / weights.sum()
```

Full implementation: `examples/henikoff_weights.py`.

**Edge case:** The implementation skips columns containing any gap, so sequences whose non-gap residues fall ONLY in gap-rich columns receive weight zero. This typically affects fragmentary or terminal-truncated sequences. HMMER's `pb` weighting handles this by including gaps as a residue type. For Pfam-style alignments where many columns are gappy, switch to `pyhmmer.easel.MSAFile` + `compute_weights(method='pb')` rather than this implementation, or augment the pure-numpy version with an `ignore_gaps=False` branch.

### Effective Sequence Number (Neff)

**Goal:** Estimate effective non-redundant sequence count after similarity-based clustering.

**Approach:** Cluster sequences at an identity threshold (HMMER and AlphaFold use 0.62 for protein, 0.80 for nucleotide), assign each sequence weight `1 / cluster_size`, and sum. `Neff/L > 0.5` is the rule-of-thumb threshold for direct-coupling-analysis contact prediction. Full implementation: `examples/neff.py`.

The thresholds reflect convention: 0.62 traces back to BLOSUM62 derivation; 0.80 is HHsuite's default for cd-hit-style clustering of the BFD database.

**Neff is estimator-dependent.** Different tools report different "Neff" values for the same MSA, often differing by 2-3x:

| Tool | Method | Typical relationship |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| HMMER, pyhmmer (`method='pb'`) | Henikoff position-based | Baseline |
| HMMER (`method='gsc'`) | Gerstein-Sonnhammer-Chothia | ~0.5-1.5x of `pb` |
| HMMER (`method='blosum'`) | BLOSUM62-similarity clusters | ~0.7-1.2x of `pb` |
| AlphaFold2 / ColabFold | MMseqs2 cluster count at id=0.62 | ~1.5-3x of `pb` (counts unique sequences, not weights) |
| EVcouplings | HHfilter clusters at id=0.80 | ~0.5-1x of `pb` |
| HHsuite `hhmake` | inverse-purity count | Closer to `pb` |

Always report which estimator was used. Threshold rules ("Neff/L > 0.5 for DCA") are calibrated against a specific estimator -- Hopf et al 2017 use HHfilter-80 cluster count; Marks et al 2011 use 70%-identity cluster reweighting. AlphaFold2's MSA-depth gating uses unweighted cluster count at 62% identity.

## Coevolution: Mutual Information with APC

**Goal:** Identify columns whose residue identities co-vary, indicating direct or indirect physical/functional coupling.

**Approach:** Compute pairwise mutual information across column pairs, then subtract the average-product correction (APC) from Dunn, Wahl & Gloor (2008 Bioinf) to remove per-column-entropy and phylogenetic background. This is the foundation of plmDCA and EVcouplings; full DCA needs Potts-model inference but APC-corrected MI runs in pure numpy and is informative on its own.

Skeleton (full implementation: `examples/mi_apc.py`):
```python
def mi_matrix_apc(alignment):
    # Compute pairwise MI across columns -> column_means -> APC = outer(means) / overall_mean
    # Return mi - apc
    ...
```

For production-grade contact prediction, switch to plmDCA (Ekeberg et al 2013 Phys Rev E) or EVcouplings (Hopf et al 2017 Nat Biotechnol). APC-corrected MI scales to a few hundred columns; deeper analyses need approximate likelihood methods.

**APC over-correction on short alignments:** APC subtracts each column-pair's product of column-average MIs. For alignments with <100 columns, the column-averages are noisy estimates dominated by their constituent column-pairs, and APC removes signal proportional to noise. Empirically on Pfam alignments <100 columns, APC-corrected MI underperforms raw MI for contact prediction (Cocco et al 2018 Rep Prog Phys review). Apply APC only when L > 100 and Neff/L > 1; below this, raw MI plus a phylogenetic-distance threshold is more reliable. plmDCA and EVcouplings auto-skip APC when input depth is insufficient.

## A2M / A3M Conventions

A2M (HMMER) and A3M (HHsuite, ColabFold) encode insert vs match columns via case (uppercase = match column residue, lowercase = insert). A3M does not pad inserts across sequences and must be reformatted to A2M before loading as a rectangular MSA. See `alignment/alignment-io` A2M / A3M Conventions section for the full character table, BioPython load pattern, and the `reformat.pl` reference-sequence pitfall.

## Streaming Large Alignments

For Pfam-scale streaming (multi-gigabyte Stockholm or A3M databases that exceed RAM), use `pyhmmer.easel.MSAFile` with `compute_weights(method='pb')` for in-flight Henikoff weighting. See `alignment/alignment-io` Streaming Large Stockholm Databases section for the full code pattern.

## Quick Reference: Common Operations

| Task | Code |
|------|------|
| Get column | `alignment[:, col_idx]` |
| Get sequence | `alignment[seq_idx]` |
| Column count | `alignment.get_alignment_length()` |
| Sequence count | `len(alignment)` |
| Find gaps | `str(record.seq).count('-')` |
| Consensus | Use custom `consensus_sequence()` function |

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `IndexError` | Column index out of range | Check `get_alignment_length()` |
| Unequal sequence lengths | Invalid MSA | Ensure all sequences same length |
| Empty Counter | All gaps in column | Handle gap-only columns |
