# Allele-Specific Accessibility

**"Does this heterozygous SNP affect chromatin accessibility on its allele?"** -> Count ATAC reads supporting reference vs alternative allele at heterozygous sites in the same individual; significant deviation from 50:50 indicates cis-regulatory effect. Requires careful handling of reference-allele mapping bias (WASP filtering) and within-individual binomial testing.

- CLI: `WASP` (Geijn 2015) for de-biased reference mapping
- CLI: `gatk ASEReadCounter` for allele-specific count tables
- CLI: `RASQUAL` (Kumasaka 2016) for joint cis-mapping with allelic counts
- R: `QuASAR` (Harvey 2015) for genotype + ASE inference simultaneously

ASE/ASB analysis is fundamentally different from cohort-level differential. Statistical framework is binomial within-individual; sample size is the count of heterozygous SNPs in accessible regions, not the number of individuals.

## Algorithmic Taxonomy

| Tool | Method | Input | Strength | Fails when |
|------|--------|-------|----------|------------|
| WASP (Geijn 2015) | Realign reads where alt allele swap could change mapping; filter mapping-bias affected sites | BAM + VCF + reference | Mandatory for any ASE/ASB analysis; controls reference-allele bias | Slow on deep coverage; requires re-alignment step |
| GATK ASEReadCounter | Count REF and ALT reads at known heterozygous sites | BAM + VCF | Mature; integrates with GATK ecosystem; standard counter | Doesn't fix mapping bias (needs WASP first); single-sample |
| RASQUAL (Kumasaka 2016) | Joint cis-eQTL/caQTL model: total counts + allelic imbalance | BAM + VCF + peak counts | Best statistical power for caQTL when sample size is moderate (N=20-100); models genotype uncertainty | Complex setup; per-feature regression (slow); requires LD computation |
| QuASAR (Harvey 2015) | Genotype + ASE inference from RNA-seq or ATAC alone | BAM (no VCF needed) | Useful when genotypes are limited; integrates phasing | Less accurate than WASP+GATK when genotypes are known |
| MatrixEQTL on per-feature counts | Linear model fit on accessibility per peak | Genotypes + peak counts | Standard cohort-level caQTL; well-supported | No allelic imbalance information; needs sample size N >= 50 |
| Allelic Imbalance from Bayesian models (MAJIQ-style) | Bayesian beta-binomial | BAM + VCF | Models overdispersion appropriately | Niche; less mature than WASP+GATK |

Methodology evolves; verify against current Geijn 2015, Kumasaka 2016, Buchkovich 2015 before locking pipelines. Modern caQTL studies typically combine WASP + RASQUAL at modest N or WASP + GATK + linear caQTL at large N.

## Reference Allele Mapping Bias (The Single Most Important Issue)

When aligning reads to the reference genome, reads carrying the reference allele align with 0 mismatches; reads carrying the alternative allele have 1 mismatch and may fail to align (especially with `bwa-mem` -k or `bowtie2 --very-sensitive` thresholds). This **inflates the apparent reference-allele frequency** at every SNP and confounds ASE.

**Trigger:** Always (mapping bias is universal at heterozygous SNPs).

**Mechanism:** Aligners are mismatch-penalized. Without correction, ALT reads systematically under-align. Effect size: 1-5% bias toward reference at typical mismatch penalties.

**Symptom:** Per-SNP REF allele fraction skews above 50% even at sites without true allelic imbalance.

**Fix:** WASP. Pseudo-alleles every read at heterozygous sites; re-aligns swapped reads; keeps only reads that map identically to both haplotypes. Mandatory for any ASE/ASB analysis.

**Goal:** Remove reference-allele mapping bias before counting allele-specific ATAC reads.

**Approach:** Identify reads overlapping heterozygous SNPs, re-align allele-swapped versions, keep only reads consistent across both haplotypes, then count REF/ALT with GATK ASEReadCounter.

```bash

## Per-Tool Failure Modes

### GATK ASEReadCounter without WASP -- Reference bias

**Trigger:** Running ASEReadCounter directly on a standard ATAC BAM without WASP filtering.

**Mechanism:** Reference allele over-counts due to alignment bias.

**Symptom:** Per-SNP reference fraction systematically > 0.5; aggregate plots show ~0.51-0.55 instead of 0.5.

**Fix:** WASP filter first, ALWAYS. There are no exceptions.

### Sample size for ASE per SNP

**Trigger:** Single-individual ATAC; per-SNP heterozygous coverage typically 10-100 reads.

**Mechanism:** Per-SNP binomial test has limited power; 10 reads at p=0.5 has 95% CI from 0.18 to 0.82 -- effectively no power for moderate effects.

**Fix:** Aggregate across many SNPs in the same peak (within-peak ASE); aggregate across replicates at same SNP; combine with cis-caQTL across cohort.

### RASQUAL -- LD computation requirement

**Trigger:** RASQUAL exits or returns NA for a feature.

**Mechanism:** RASQUAL estimates genotype/allelic correlation internally from the tabix-streamed VCF (no external LD matrix is needed or accepted). Failures instead come from the `-l` (testing SNP) and `-m` (feature SNP) counts not matching the SNPs actually present in the cis-window, or a feature with zero fSNPs.

**Fix:** Compute `-l`/`-m` from the actual VCF window rather than a fixed guess, and skip features with no feature SNPs; there is no LD-precompute step.

### WASP -- Phased vs unphased genotypes

**Trigger:** Using unphased genotypes for ASE.

**Mechanism:** ASE requires knowing which allele is on which haplotype to assign reads. Unphased het sites ambiguously assign reads.

**Fix:** Phase genotypes with SHAPEIT5, BEAGLE 5.4, or whatshap (read-based) before running WASP/ASE counter.

### Cohort-level caQTL without allelic info

**Trigger:** MatrixEQTL on peak counts without ASE.

**Mechanism:** MatrixEQTL maps cohort-level associations; misses cis-mode that ASE captures within individual.

**Symptom:** Power to detect caQTL is low (typical N=50-100 cohort gives ~hundreds of caQTLs vs ASE-augmented can give thousands).

**Fix:** Use RASQUAL (joint total + ASE) when N <= 100; or combine MatrixEQTL with separate ASE per individual.

### Read-deep peak coverage required

**Trigger:** Per-peak coverage < 30 reads at SNP site.

**Mechanism:** Binomial test power at p=0.5, n=30 yields detectable shifts only at |delta_p| >= 0.2.

**Fix:** Pool replicates if available; or restrict to peaks with sufficient coverage; or aggregate to per-individual peak-level ASE rather than per-SNP.

## Decision Tree by Setting

| Setting | Recommended pipeline |
|---------|---------------------|
| Single individual, ATAC + genotypes | WASP + GATK ASEReadCounter -> per-SNP and per-peak ASE; within-peak aggregation |
| Cohort N >= 100, want caQTL | WASP + GATK + MatrixEQTL on peak counts; supplement with ASE for cis-effects |
| Cohort N = 20-100 | WASP + RASQUAL (joint total + ASE) for max power |
| Cohort with no genotypes | QuASAR (infers genotypes from data) |
| Validating GWAS variant function | Look up het samples in cohort; aggregate ASE at the variant; ASB ratio |
| Trios or quartets | Per-trio phasing then ASE per individual |
| iPSC line genotype validation | Single-individual ASE at known SNPs |

## Cohort caQTL Pipeline

**Goal:** Build cohort-level chromatin QTLs by combining WASP-corrected per-sample counts with cis-genotype association.

**Approach:** WASP-correct each BAM, build consensus peakset, count reads in peaks per sample, then test cis-genotype association via MatrixEQTL (cohort) or RASQUAL (joint total + allelic).

```bash
# 1. WASP-correct each individual's BAM
for sample in $(cat samples.txt); do
    bash wasp_pipeline.sh $sample.bam $sample.vcf
done

# 2. Build consensus peakset (atac-seq/consensus-peakset)
# 3. Count reads in peaks per sample (featureCounts)
featureCounts -F SAF -a consensus.saf -o counts.tsv -p --countReadPairs *.wasp.bam

# 4. Cohort-level caQTL via MatrixEQTL
# (see R script in examples/)

# 5. Per-individual ASE (RASQUAL alternative)
# Parallel: gatk ASEReadCounter per sample, then merge for QuASAR meta-analysis
```

## Within-Peak ASE Aggregation

**Goal:** Boost per-SNP ASE power by pooling allele counts across heterozygous SNPs in the same peak.

**Approach:** Map each het SNP to its containing peak, sum REF and ALT counts per peak, run pooled binomial test against 50:50, apply BH FDR, and threshold on effect size.

```python
import pandas as pd, numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Per-SNP allele counts at heterozygous sites
ase = pd.read_csv('sample.ase_counts.tsv', sep='\t')
ase = ase.rename(columns={'refCount': 'REF', 'altCount': 'ALT'})
ase['totalCount'] = ase['REF'] + ase['ALT']

# Map each SNP to its containing peak
ase['peak'] = map_snps_to_peaks(ase, 'consensus_peaks.bed')

# Aggregate within peak: pooled binomial test
def peak_ase(group):
    ref = group['REF'].sum()
    total = group['totalCount'].sum()
    if total < 30: return pd.Series({'ref_frac': np.nan, 'p_value': np.nan})
    p = stats.binomtest(ref, total, p=0.5).pvalue
    return pd.Series({'ref_frac': ref / total, 'p_value': p, 'snp_count': len(group)})

peak_ase_df = ase.groupby('peak').apply(peak_ase)
peak_ase_df['adj_p'] = stats.false_discovery_control(peak_ase_df['p_value'].fillna(1.0))
sig_ase = peak_ase_df[(peak_ase_df['adj_p'] < 0.05) & (abs(peak_ase_df['ref_frac'] - 0.5) >= 0.2)]
```

|ref_frac - 0.5| >= 0.2 is a 30:70 effect; smaller imbalances are detectable but biologically minor. Per-peak SNP count >= 2 strengthens the call.

## RASQUAL Joint Modeling

RASQUAL uses a non-standard CLI: it reads the VCF from stdin via tabix and uses single-letter flags. The canonical invocation pattern is:

**Goal:** Combine total accessibility counts and allele-specific counts into one joint cis-caQTL test per peak.

**Approach:** Pre-build binary count and offset files via rasqualTools, then iterate per-feature, streaming the cis-window VCF through tabix into RASQUAL with feature coordinates and SNP counts.

```bash
# 1. Pre-compute genotype offsets and binary count files (rasqualTools R package)
# (see rasqualTools::saveRasqualMatrices; produces .bin files for -y, -k)

# 2. Per-feature (peak) RASQUAL call: pipe tabix VCF in via stdin
# Per-line meaning: feature name, chromosome, start, end, n_testing_SNPs (cis-window rSNP candidates), n_feature_SNPs (fSNPs in the peak)
while IFS=$'\t' read -r name chr start end n_testing n_feature; do
    tabix cohort.vcf.gz $chr:$((start-500000))-$((end+500000)) | \
        rasqual -y counts.bin \
                -k offsets.bin \
                -n $N_SAMPLES \
                -j $FEATURE_INDEX \
                -l $n_testing -m $n_feature \
                -s $start -e $end \
                -f $name \
                > $name.rasqual.txt
done < features.tsv
```

`-y` is the binary count file; `-k` is the binary size-factor / offset file (both produced by `rasqualTools::saveRasqualMatrices` from R); `-j` is the row index of the feature; `-l` is the number of testing SNPs (cis-window rSNP candidates) and `-m` the number of feature SNPs (fSNPs overlapping the peak). RASQUAL does NOT use `--features`, `--counts`, `--vcf` flags; those are common in newer caQTL wrappers but not in stock RASQUAL.

For modern usage, the `rasqualTools` R wrapper (Kumasaka GitHub) handles this orchestration. Verify against `rasqual --help` because the flag set is unusual.

RASQUAL output includes joint p-values, total-only and ASE-only sub-tests; the joint test typically gains 1.5-3x power vs MatrixEQTL alone.

## Reconciliation

| Pattern | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| GATK ASE shows REF > ALT systematically | WASP not run | Re-run with WASP filter; bias fixed |
| RASQUAL joint p << ASE-only p | Cis effect dominated by allelic component | Confirms cis-regulatory mechanism |
| ASE detected at SNP not in peak | Possible coding splice or 3' UTR effect | Check annotation; may not be regulatory |
| Cohort caQTL doesn't replicate per-individual ASE | Trans effect or technical artifact | Consider trans-effect; or single-individual outliers |

**Operational rule for high-confidence reporting:** A cis-regulatory variant must show (a) WASP-filtered allelic imbalance with adjusted p < 0.05 and effect size >= 0.2, AND (b) cohort-level caQTL p < 1e-5 (or RASQUAL joint p < 1e-5), AND (c) accessibility peak overlap. Validation against MPRA or CRISPRi-FlowFISH increases confidence.

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Reference allele systematically over-represented | WASP not run | Mandatory WASP filter |
| ASE per-SNP coverage too low | Sparse coverage; rare alleles | Aggregate across SNPs in peak; or filter SNPs with allele freq 0.1-0.9 |
| RASQUAL crashes/NA on small features | Feature has no fSNPs, or `-l`/`-m` counts mismatch the VCF window | Skip features with 0 feature-SNPs; compute `-l`/`-m` from the actual window |
| caQTL replication low | Cohort-effect vs cis-effect confusion | Use RASQUAL joint or replicate ASE separately |
| Phased vs unphased confusion | Different software expectations | Phase with SHAPEIT5/BEAGLE before any ASE |
| GATK ASEReadCounter fails on multiallelic sites | Multi-allelic complications | Pre-filter VCF to biallelic only with bcftools |
| WASP runs slow | Re-alignment step is dominant | Parallelize per-chromosome; or use samtools faidx + region-based parallelism |
