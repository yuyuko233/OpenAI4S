description: Co-designs qPCR/RT-qPCR primers and hydrolysis (TaqMan) or molecular-beacon probes with primer3-py (PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO, PRIMER_INTERNAL_* tags), for assays whose deliverable is a quantitative measurement device. Covers why amplification efficiency (90-110%, slope -3.6 to -3.1) and single-product specificity make the 2^-ddCq / Pfaffl math valid, why the short amplicon (70-150 bp), tight Tm, and zero-dimer requirement exist, the coupled probe rules (probe Tm 8-10 C above primers so it is bound when Taq's exonuclease cleaves it; no 5' G as it quenches the reporter; C-rich strand; primer3 has NO no-5'-G tag so enforce PRIMER_INTERNAL_MUST_MATCH_FIVE_PRIME=HNNNN), gDNA exclusion by exon-junction spanning AND why pseudogenes defeat it, SYBR melt-curve QC, and reference-gene validation (geNorm/NormFinder). Use when designing TaqMan/SYBR assays, exon-spanning primers, probes, or matched-efficiency multiplex panels. Genome specificity is primer-specificity; dimers primer-validation; standard PCR primer-basics.

# qPCR Primer and Probe Design -- Building a Quantitative Measurement Device

**"Design qPCR primers (and a probe) for this target"** -> Co-design a short, single-product, Tm-matched amplicon with an optional internal probe whose constraints are coupled to the primers -- because the assay's job is not to amplify but to MEASURE, and every qPCR-specific rule protects the efficiency the quantification math assumes.
- Python: `primer3.design_primers(seq_args, global_args)` with `PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO=1` and `PRIMER_INTERNAL_*` for the probe.

Scope: co-designing qPCR/RT-qPCR primers and hydrolysis/beacon probes under coupled Tm/size/junction constraints. Genome-wide specificity / pseudogene checking -> primer-specificity. Intramolecular dimers/hairpins of the oligos and probe -> primer-validation. Standard (non-quantitative) PCR -> primer-basics.

## The Single Most Important Modern Insight -- A qPCR Assay Is a Measurement Device, and Efficiency Is a Parameter in the Equation, Not a QC Afterthought

1. **Validity rests on efficiency and specificity.** A Cq difference maps to a true fold-change only through `(1+E)^-dCq` (at ideal E=1, `2^-ddCq`). That requires amplification efficiency E ~ 90-110% (standard-curve slope -3.6 to -3.1, R^2 > 0.99) AND a single product. The short amplicon (70-150 bp), tight Tm, and zero-dimer requirement all exist to protect E and specificity. `2^-ddCq` is valid ONLY when the target and reference-gene efficiencies are matched and near 100% -- so design for matched ~100% E, or fall back to Pfaffl's efficiency-corrected model.
2. **The probe is coupled to the primers, not bolted on.** A hydrolysis probe must be BOUND when the polymerase extends through it (so Taq's 5'->3' exonuclease cleaves it and frees the reporter), which is why its Tm must sit 8-10 C ABOVE the primer Tm. It must NOT start with G (a 5'-G quenches the reporter even after cleavage), and the C-rich strand is preferred because G-richness anywhere near the reporter also quenches it. primer3's internal-oligo Tm defaults EQUAL the primer defaults, so they must be raised, and there is no dedicated no-5'-G tag -- enforce it with `PRIMER_INTERNAL_MUST_MATCH_FIVE_PRIME='HNNNN'` (IUPAC H = not G) or a post-hoc filter. This is the hydrolysis (TaqMan) probe path; a molecular beacon needs engineered complementary stem arms (a deliberate hairpin) that primer3's internal-oligo picker does NOT design and would flag as a liability -- design the linear core here, add the stem afterward, and exclude that hairpin from validation.
3. **Design-level gDNA exclusion is real but leaky.** Exon-junction-spanning or intron-flanking primers reduce genomic-DNA amplification, but processed pseudogenes (intronless retro-copies that usually carry the junction) defeat junction-spanning, and tiny introns defeat flanking. So DNase + a no-RT control + a genome specificity check (-> primer-specificity) remain mandatory; single-exon genes have no design-level option at all.

## The Quantification Math (Why the Constraints Exist)

Efficiency from a standard curve: `E = 10^(-1/slope) - 1`; perfect doubling is slope -3.32 (E = 100%). Relative quantification with matched ~100% efficiency uses `2^-ddCq` (Livak & Schmittgen 2001 *Methods* 25:402); with UNEQUAL efficiencies use the efficiency-corrected ratio `E_target^dCq / E_ref^dCq` (Pfaffl 2001 *Nucleic Acids Res* 29:e45). Report per MIQE (Bustin 2009 *Clin Chem* 55:611): efficiency, slope, R^2, Cq method, NTC and no-RT controls, and validated reference genes. The design objective is therefore "single short amplicon with slope near -3.32," not "two oligos that amplify."

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Probe-based (multiplex-capable, second specificity check) | TaqMan: `PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO=1`, probe Tm 8-10 C above primers, `HNNNN` 5' | the probe adds sequence specificity and enables multiplex |
| Single target, cheapest, no probe | SYBR (no internal oligo) + mandatory melt-curve QC | dye reports any dsDNA; melt curve is the specificity readout |
| Expression assay, avoid gDNA | exon-junction-spanning primers (`SEQUENCE_OVERLAP_JUNCTION_LIST`) | the junction does not exist contiguously in unspliced gDNA |
| Gene has a processed pseudogene | junction-spanning is NOT enough -> primer-specificity (search genome) + no-RT control | the pseudogene carries the junction |
| Single-exon gene (no junction) | DNase + no-RT control; no design-level gDNA exclusion | there is no intron/junction to exploit |
| AT-rich target / allele discrimination | MGB or LNA probe (shorter, higher effective Tm) | raises probe Tm where a standard probe cannot reach |
| Multiplex panel | spectrally distinct fluorophores, matched E, primer-limiting, all-pairs cross-dimer | competition and cross-dimers dominate; primer-limiting = drop the abundant target's primer concentration so it plateaus early and stops starving the rare target of shared reagents |
| Choosing normalizers | rank a candidate panel with geNorm/NormFinder, validate per condition | a single unvalidated reference gene is a classic error |

Default when uncertain: TaqMan primers+probe, amplicon 70-150 bp, primers Tm ~60 C (within 2 C), probe Tm ~68-70 C with `HNNNN`, exon-junction-spanning for expression, then route the pair to primer-specificity and run a standard curve.

## Co-Design Primers and a TaqMan Probe

**Goal:** Produce a short, Tm-matched amplicon with an internal probe whose Tm is 8-10 C above the primers and whose 5' base is not G.

**Approach:** Turn on internal-oligo picking, set the primer Tm window and a short product range, RAISE the `PRIMER_INTERNAL_*` Tm window 8-10 C above the primers (the defaults equal the primer Tm), and forbid a 5'-G probe with `PRIMER_INTERNAL_MUST_MATCH_FIVE_PRIME='HNNNN'`. For an expression assay add `SEQUENCE_OVERLAP_JUNCTION_LIST`.

```python
import primer3

template = 'ATGC...'  # cDNA (mark the junction position if expression-specific)

result = primer3.design_primers(
    seq_args={'SEQUENCE_ID': 'assay1', 'SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE': template},
    global_args={
        'PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER': 1, 'PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER': 1,
        'PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO': 1,                 # design the probe
        'PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE': [[70, 150]],        # short amplicon for efficiency
        'PRIMER_NUM_RETURN': 3,
        'PRIMER_OPT_TM': 60.0, 'PRIMER_MIN_TM': 58.0, 'PRIMER_MAX_TM': 62.0,
        'PRIMER_PAIR_MAX_DIFF_TM': 2.0,
        'PRIMER_INTERNAL_OPT_TM': 70.0, 'PRIMER_INTERNAL_MIN_TM': 68.0, 'PRIMER_INTERNAL_MAX_TM': 72.0,
        'PRIMER_INTERNAL_MUST_MATCH_FIVE_PRIME': 'HNNNN',  # IUPAC H = A/C/T = not G at the probe 5' end
        # 'SEQUENCE_OVERLAP_JUNCTION_LIST': [junction_pos],  # add for cDNA-specific assays
    })

for i in range(result['PRIMER_PAIR_NUM_RETURNED']):
    probe = result[f'PRIMER_INTERNAL_{i}_SEQUENCE']
    print(result[f'PRIMER_LEFT_{i}_SEQUENCE'], result[f'PRIMER_RIGHT_{i}_SEQUENCE'], probe,
          'probe5=', probe[0], 'probeTm=', round(result[f'PRIMER_INTERNAL_{i}_TM'], 1),
          'size=', result[f'PRIMER_PAIR_{i}_PRODUCT_SIZE'])
```

## Exon-Junction Spanning, and Its Limits

For a cDNA-specific assay, place a primer or the probe across a splice junction with `SEQUENCE_OVERLAP_JUNCTION_LIST = [pos]` plus `PRIMER_MIN_3_PRIME_OVERLAP_OF_JUNCTION` (default 4) and `PRIMER_MIN_5_PRIME_OVERLAP_OF_JUNCTION` (default 7); the 3' overlap is the specificity-determining knob because a primer that only overlaps at its 5' end can still prime off gDNA from its 3' anchor. The internal-oligo equivalents (`PRIMER_INTERNAL_MIN_3_PRIME_OVERLAP_OF_JUNCTION` / `_5_PRIME_`) constrain the probe. The hard caveat: this does NOT protect against processed pseudogenes, which typically carry the junction in DNA -- so the assay still needs a genome specificity check (-> primer-specificity), DNase treatment, and a no-RT control. Intron-flanking (primers in different exons across a large intron) is the alternative, but fails across tiny introns.

## Assembling a Multiplex Panel

Multiplex is the most failure-prone mode; assemble it in order: (1) design each assay independently (short amplicon, matched Tm, probe offset); (2) check ALL primer+probe oligos pairwise for cross-dimers -- for k assays that is O((2k primers + k probes)^2) checks (a 5-plex = 10 primers + 5 probes = 105 pairwise calls), weighting 3'-end involvement (-> primer-validation); (3) run in-silico PCR over the POOLED primer set so cross-pair amplicons (one assay's forward meeting another's reverse) are caught (-> primer-specificity); (4) assign spectrally distinct fluorophores -- the instrument's optical channels and spectral overlap CAP the plex (most platforms resolve ~4-6 dyes, with color compensation), so the channel count, not the chemistry, usually limits a high-plex; (5) match efficiencies on a multiplex standard curve and primer-limit the abundant targets so they do not starve the rare ones.

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### Fold-changes reported without measuring efficiency
**Trigger:** Applying `2^-ddCq` without a standard curve. **Mechanism:** the method assumes target and reference efficiencies are matched and ~100%; if not, fold-changes are systematically biased. **Symptom:** numbers that are not measurements; results that do not replicate across instruments. **Fix:** run a standard curve, report E/slope/R^2 (MIQE), and use Pfaffl if efficiencies differ.

### Probe Tm not 8-10 C above primers
**Trigger:** Leaving `PRIMER_INTERNAL_*` Tm at the default (equal to the primers). **Mechanism:** the probe is not bound when the polymerase extends through it, so the exonuclease never cleaves it. **Symptom:** weak or no TaqMan signal. **Fix:** raise the internal Tm window 8-10 C above the primer window.

### 5'-G on the probe
**Trigger:** Not forbidding a 5' guanine. **Mechanism:** a 5'-G quenches the reporter even after cleavage. **Symptom:** low signal despite good amplification. **Fix:** `PRIMER_INTERNAL_MUST_MATCH_FIVE_PRIME='HNNNN'` or filter returned probes; prefer the C-rich strand.

### Assuming exon-junction primers are gDNA-proof
**Trigger:** Trusting junction-spanning alone. **Mechanism:** processed pseudogenes carry the spliced junction in genomic DNA. **Symptom:** a positive no-RT control; a genomic amplicon at the cDNA size. **Fix:** genome specificity check (primer-specificity), DNase, and a no-RT control.

### Primer-dimers in a SYBR assay
**Trigger:** Any extendable cross-dimer with SYBR detection. **Mechanism:** the dye reports the dimer, which competes with and can swamp a low-copy target. **Symptom:** a low-Tm shoulder in the melt curve; inflated NTC/low-copy signal. **Fix:** inspect the melt curve for a single sharp peak; validate dimers at reaction conditions (primer-validation).

### Single, unvalidated reference gene
**Trigger:** Normalizing to GAPDH/ACTB by habit. **Mechanism:** the reference may itself be regulated by the treatment. **Symptom:** apparent target changes that track a moving normalizer. **Fix:** rank a candidate panel with geNorm/NormFinder and validate stability in the actual experimental conditions.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Efficiency 90-110% (slope -3.6 to -3.1, ideal -3.32), R^2 > 0.99 | Bustin 2009 *Clin Chem* 55:611 | the acceptance band that keeps `2^-ddCq` valid |
| Amplicon 70-150 bp | Bustin 2009 *Clin Chem* 55:611 | short products denature/re-prime fully each short cycle -> ~100% E |
| Primer Tm ~58-62 C, pair within 2 C | Koressaar & Remm 2007 *Bioinformatics* 23:1289 | one anneal-extend temperature; matched so neither lags |
| Probe Tm 8-10 C above primer Tm | -- | probe bound before/during extension so the exonuclease can cleave it |
| Probe: no 5'-G, prefer C-rich strand | -- | a 5'-G (and G-richness) quenches the reporter; the standard rule for 5'-reporter hydrolysis probes (reporter/quencher-chemistry dependent) |
| Standard curve: 5-6 points, 10-fold, triplicate | Bustin 2009 *Clin Chem* 55:611 | defines E, R^2, dynamic range, LOD |
| Reference genes: >=2 validated | Vandesompele 2002 *Genome Biol* 3:RESEARCH0034 | geometric mean of stable references beats one gene |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Weak/no TaqMan signal | probe Tm too low, or 5'-G | raise `PRIMER_INTERNAL_*` Tm 8-10 C; `HNNNN`; C-rich strand |
| No probe returned (0 pairs) | internal Tm window unreachable on this template | widen/lower internal Tm or product range; check with `PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG=1` |
| Positive no-RT control | gDNA / pseudogene amplification | junction-span + genome check (primer-specificity) + DNase |
| Poor efficiency (slope steep/shallow) | amplicon too long, dimers, off-target, or template inhibitors/degraded standard | shorten amplicon, fix dimers (primer-validation), check specificity, clean up template |
| Low-Tm melt peak (SYBR) | primer-dimer | redesign to remove 3'-end cross-dimers (primer-validation) |
| Fold-changes do not replicate | unmatched efficiency, unvalidated reference | match E or use Pfaffl; validate references with geNorm/NormFinder |
