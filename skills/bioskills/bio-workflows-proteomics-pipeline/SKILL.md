description: Orchestrates bottom-up proteomics from a search engine's output (MaxQuant/FragPipe/DIA-NN) to differential protein abundance with limma/DEqMS/MSstats. Use when committing the search database + acquisition mode (DDA vs DIA) up front, re-controlling FDR at PSM AND peptide AND protein-group level (not just PSM), removing contaminant/reverse rows and inspecting RAW distributions before normalizing, bridging cross-plex TMT with an IRS reference channel, modeling MNAR missingness rather than downshift-imputing on/off proteins, batching as a covariate (not pre-subtracted), and testing with treat()/DEqMS. Hands mechanism to the proteomics component skills; not a re-teach of any single step.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: MSnbase 2.28+, limma 3.58+, DEqMS 1.20+, proDA 1.20+, MSstatsTMT 2.10+, arrow 15.0+ (DIA-NN report.parquet), ggplot2 3.5+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Proteomics Pipeline

**"Process my proteomics data from raw MS files to differential abundance"** -> Orchestrate data import (pyopenms/MaxQuant), QC assessment, protein quantification, normalization, differential abundance testing (limma/DEqMS, or MSstats for feature-level designs), and PTM analysis.

This is a workflow skill: it owns the chaining decisions and hand-offs, not the internals of any one step.

## The governing principle

Bottom-up proteomics never measures proteins; it measures peptides and INFERS proteins, and the trustworthiness decisions are made at seams before the statistics.

1. **The search database + acquisition mode are committed once and inherited by everything.** The FASTA fixes the target-decoy frame (concatenated one-search FDR = #decoy/#target; a separate-search design needs mix-max instead — mixing the two mis-estimates FDR), what counts as a "unique peptide" (relative to the DB: canonical vs +isoforms), and the contaminants (cRAP must be IN the search DB from the start; a contaminant can BE the protein of interest, so never blind-delete `CON__` rows). DDA vs DIA is set at the instrument and dictates which imputation is even legitimate.
2. **FDR is re-controlled at THREE levels, not just PSM — and match-between-runs has its OWN FDR.** 1% PSM-FDR does NOT give 1% protein-FDR — each level (PSM, peptide, protein-group) needs its own target-decoy estimation; PSM-only filtering yields 10-30% real protein-FDR on deep data (one false PSM nucleates a false one-hit-wonder, and false proteins grow with dataset size). Use picked-protein/picked-group FDR. The two-peptide rule INCREASES protein-FDR, it does not reduce it. MBR transfers IDs across runs by RT/m-z and can be wrong for low-abundance precursors — do NOT report MBR-filled counts as directly measured; DIA-NN controls MBR-FDR via `Lib.*` q-values, IonQuant via an explicit MBR-FDR mixture model.
3. **Missingness is MODELED, not filled.** DDA missingness is structured left-censored MNAR; downshift imputation (mean=mu-1.8sigma) on an on/off protein inflates the t-numerator AND deflates the denominator (the volcano "wing" artifact). The honest report for a protein missing in one whole group is "undetected in group B", not a fold change — model the MNAR (proDA/msqrob2/MSstats-AFT).
4. **Normalize AFTER contaminant removal and AFTER inspecting raw distributions; batch is a covariate, not pre-subtracted.** Median-normalizing first mathematically erases a 3x-low load. Cross-plex TMT is invalid without an IRS bridge. `removeBatchEffect` before testing understates residual variance (anticonservative p) — put batch in the same model.

## Made-once commitments

| Commitment | Consequence inherited downstream |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Search FASTA + target-decoy strategy | The FDR estimator, what a "unique peptide" is, which contaminants exist; a mismatch mis-estimates FDR silently |
| Enzyme + fixed/variable mods (Carbamidomethyl-Cys fixed) | Which peptides exist to quantify; a fixed-mod misconfig loses all Cys peptides |
| DDA vs DIA acquisition mode | Missingness structure (MNAR vs ~MCAR), whether TMT is possible, which imputation is legitimate |
| FDR framing (PSM + peptide + protein-group, 1% each) | Real protein-FDR; PSM-only is 10-30% wrong on deep data |

## Complete R Workflow

**Goal:** Turn a MaxQuant or DIA-NN protein matrix into a table of differentially abundant proteins with honest missing-value handling.

**Approach:** Strip bookkeeping rows, log2 and inspect the RAW per-sample distributions (dropping failed loads before normalization can hide them), median-center, filter on per-group completeness, then model the dropout with proDA (or fall back to imputation), and test with moderated limma using treat() for a minimum fold change.

```r

# === 1. DATA IMPORT ===
proteins <- read.delim('proteinGroups.txt', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

intensities[intensities == 0] <- NA
log2_int <- log2(intensities)

# Inspect BEFORE normalizing (rule 4). Median-centering rescales every sample onto a common median,
# so it mathematically erases the 3x-low load that marks a failed injection -- after this point the
# failure is invisible. Identify and drop failures HERE.
boxplot(log2_int, las = 2, main = 'RAW log2 LFQ (pre-normalization)', ylab = 'log2 intensity')

# Missingness in label-free DDA is left-censored MNAR (missing BECAUSE low). The modern,
# correct approach is to MODEL the missingness in the likelihood, NOT impute it. See
# proteomics/differential-abundance for the decision (proDA / msqrob2 / MSstats-AFT). The
# proDA path below is the RECOMMENDED route; the impute-then-limma path is a fallback.

# --- RECOMMENDED: model the missingness with proDA (no imputation) ---
# library(proDA)
# fit <- proDA(as.matrix(filtered), design = ~ condition, col_data = sample_info,
#              reference_level = 'Control')
# da <- test_diff(fit, contrast = 'conditionTreatment')   # columns: diff (log2FC), pval, adj_pval
# (Skip the === 5-6 impute/limma blocks below when using proDA.)

# --- FALLBACK ONLY: left-censored downshift imputation, then limma ---
# WARNING: downshift MANUFACTURES systematic false positives for on/off proteins near the
# detection limit (the volcano "anchor arms"): it pins missing values ~1.8 SD below the mean
# with an artificially tight 0.3 SD spread, inflating the t-statistic. The honest report for
# a protein fully missing in one group is "undetected in group B", NOT a fold change.

## MSstats Workflow

```r
library(MSstats)

# From MaxQuant
evidence <- read.table('evidence.txt', sep = '\t', header = TRUE)
proteinGroups <- read.table('proteinGroups.txt', sep = '\t', header = TRUE)
annotation <- read.csv('annotation.csv')

# Process data
processed <- dataProcess(msstats_input, normalization = 'equalizeMedians',
                         summaryMethod = 'TMP', censoredInt = 'NA')

# Comparison. +1 on the numerator: Treatment=+1, Control=-1 so log2FC = Treatment - Control
# (positive = up in Treatment), matching the label and the limma makeContrasts(Treatment-Control) path.
comparison <- matrix(c(-1, 1), nrow = 1)

```

## QC Checkpoints

| Stage | Check | Action if Failed |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| Import | >1000 proteins | Re-run MaxQuant |
| Filter | <30% removed | Check sample prep |
| Missing | <40% per sample | Check MS performance |
| PCA | Replicates cluster | Check for batch effects |
| Stats | FC/FDR pre-specified | Verify thresholds were pre-specified; inspect the volcano for downshift-imputation 'anchor arms' |

## Workflow Variants

### TMT/iTRAQ Isobaric Labeling
Reporter extraction is a spectra-level step, not a text-matrix read. Within a single plex the channels are co-isolated/co-fragmented in the same MS2 event, so relative ratios are stable; but MULTI-batch TMT CANNOT be compared across plexes without an IRS bridge (a pooled reference channel in every plex; Plubell 2017). Route to proteomics/quantification for the mechanics.
```r
library(MSnbase)

# Extract reporter ions from spectra (NOT readMSnSet, which loads an existing text matrix)
raw <- readMSData('tmt.mzML', mode = 'onDisk')
tmt_data <- quantify(raw, reporters = TMT10, method = 'max')
# Correct isobaric impurity cross-talk with the LOT-SPECIFIC matrix from the reagent CoA.
# edit=FALSE avoids the interactive editor (default edit=TRUE blocks in scripts); load the CoA
# cross-talk values rather than the near-identity template makeImpuritiesMatrix(10) returns alone.
impurities <- makeImpuritiesMatrix(filename = 'tmt10_coa.csv', edit = FALSE)
tmt_data <- purityCorrect(tmt_data, impurities)

# Multi-batch TMT: do NOT concatenate plexes directly. Use MSstatsTMT, which applies the
# reference-channel (IRS) bridge during summarization:
#   library(MSstatsTMT)
#   summ <- proteinSummarization(msstatstmt_input)   # includes the cross-plex bridge
#   groupComparisonTMT(summ, contrast.matrix = comparison)
```

### SILAC Workflow
Caveat: heavy-Arg -> heavy-Pro metabolic conversion biases ratios for proline-containing peptides (under-counts the heavy channel), and labeling efficiency must be checked (residual light reads as down-regulation). Route to proteomics/quantification for the mechanics.
```r
# SILAC ratios from MaxQuant
silac <- read.delim('proteinGroups.txt')
ratio_cols <- grep('Ratio.H.L.normalized', colnames(silac), value = TRUE)

# Log2 transform ratios
silac_log2 <- log2(silac[, ratio_cols])

# One-sample t-test against 0 (no change)
results <- apply(silac_log2, 1, function(x) t.test(x, mu = 0)$p.value)
```

### DIA-NN Workflow
DIA-NN 1.9+ defaults to report.parquet (the only default in 2.0); read it with arrow, not read.delim. Filter on q-values BEFORE pivoting, or low-confidence rows enter the matrix. Route to proteomics/dia-analysis for the mechanics.
```r
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

diann <- read_parquet('report.parquet')

# Filter to 1% FDR at precursor AND protein-group level before pivoting.
# Use the GLOBAL protein-group q-value for the cross-run matrix (per-run min(Q.Value) is anti-conservative).
# When MBR is ON, MBR has its own FDR: add the Lib.* q-values (Lib.Q.Value, Lib.PG.Q.Value <= 0.01).
diann_filt <- diann %>%
    filter(Q.Value <= 0.01 & PG.Q.Value <= 0.01 & Global.PG.Q.Value <= 0.01)

# PG.MaxLFQ is ALREADY cross-run MaxLFQ-normalized at report generation. Re-normalizing it
# double-normalizes -- go straight to log2 + limma with no further normalization. To apply the
# skill's own median-centering instead, pivot raw PG.Quantity here, not PG.MaxLFQ.
protein_matrix <- diann_filt %>%
    select(Protein.Group, Run, PG.MaxLFQ) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Run, values_from = PG.MaxLFQ)

# PG.MaxLFQ path: log2-transform and go straight to limma (no re-normalization)
```

## Common Errors

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| ~1% PSM-FDR but 10-30% wrong proteins | FDR controlled only at PSM level | Estimate FDR at peptide AND protein-group level (picked-group FDR) |
| Volcano "wings" of huge-FC on/off proteins | Downshift imputation on MNAR (Perseus/MaxQuant) | Model the MNAR (proDA/msqrob2/MSstats-AFT); report "undetected in group B", not a fold change |
| Cross-plex TMT ratios differ 2-5x for no biology | Compared TMT across plexes without IRS | Pooled reference channel in EVERY plex + IRS bridge before comparison |
| A failed-load sample silently carried forward | Normalized before inspecting raw distributions | Filter contaminant/reverse rows -> inspect raw boxplots + ID counts -> remove failures -> THEN normalize |
| Anticonservative p-values | `removeBatchEffect` before testing | Put batch in the model (`~ batch + condition`); removeBatchEffect only for PCA |
| Every ratio subtly wrong | Wrong intensity column (`Intensity` vs `LFQ intensity` vs `iBAQ`) | Pick the right column; convert 0 -> NaN before log2 |
| Spurious DA that flips between conditions | Razor-peptide inference reassigns a shared peptide | Quantify at protein-group level or unique-peptides-only for sensitive comparisons |
