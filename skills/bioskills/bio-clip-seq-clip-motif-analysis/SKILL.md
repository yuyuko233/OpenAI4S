Reference examples tested with: HOMER 4.11+, MEME Suite 5.5+ (STREME, MEME-ChIP, FIMO), bedtools 2.31+, kpLogo 1.1+, mCross v1+, PEKA v1+, RBPamp 0.9+, ggseqlogo 0.1+, biopython 1.83+.

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- CLI: `<tool> --version` then `<tool> --help` to confirm flags
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws unexpected errors, introspect the installed tool and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# CLIP-seq Motif Analysis

**"Find enriched RNA motifs at my RBP binding sites"** -> Discover the in vivo sequence preference of an RNA-binding protein from CLIP-seq peaks or single-nucleotide crosslink sites. The fundamental confound is the uracil bias of UV254 crosslinking: U is the most-crosslinked base, so naive motif logos centered on CL positions are U-enriched even for non-U-binding RBPs. Modern tools (mCross, PEKA) register motifs relative to the CL position and correct for this bias; legacy tools (HOMER, MEME) need careful background selection.

- CLI (de novo, peak-based, HOMER RNA mode): `findMotifs.pl peaks.fa fasta motif_out -rna -len 5,6,7,8 -p 4`
- CLI (de novo, peak-based, MEME-ChIP / STREME): `streme --rna --oc streme_out -p peaks.fa -n background.fa --minw 5 --maxw 10`
- CLI (positional, single-nt CL-registered, mCross): `mCross -i crosslinks.bed -g genome.fa -k 7 -o mcross_out` (jointly models motif + CL position)
- CLI (positional k-mer, no input control needed, PEKA): `peka --peak_file_name peaks.bed --crosslinks_file_name crosslinks.bed --genome_file_name genome.fa --regions_file_name regions.bed --kmer_length 5 --percentile 30 --outpath peka_out` (the short flags `-i/-x/-g/-r/-k/-p` shown in earlier docs are not all stable; use the long forms or check `peka --help`)
- CLI (affinity-weighted, RBPamp): `rbpamp run -i peaks.fa -k 7 -o rbpamp_out` (joint affinity + motif model)
- CLI (positional logo, kpLogo): `kpLogo crosslinks_with_kmer_scores.txt -o kplogo_out` (position-specific significance)

ENCODE eCLIP motif convention: extract sequences from peaks (CLIPper + SMInput stringent), use shuffled or expression-matched background, run HOMER `-rna -len 5,6,7,8`. The Yeo lab eCLIP papers typically report the top 1-3 HOMER hits per RBP and validate with mCross for CL-registered position. For ASB and variant-effect work, mCross is mandatory.

## Algorithmic Taxonomy

| Tool | Input | Background | CL-position aware | Output | Strength | Fails when |
|------|-------|------------|-------------------|--------|----------|------------|
| HOMER findMotifs.pl | Peak FASTA | Auto-shuffled or user-provided | No | PWM + de novo + known scan | Mature, fast, RNA mode (U instead of T) | Background generation is heuristic; uracil bias inflates U-content motifs |
| MEME (MEME Suite) | Peak FASTA | Optional Markov model | No | PWM | Statistically rigorous; broadly cited | Slow on large peak sets (> 1000 sequences); single-motif default |
| STREME (MEME Suite) | Peak FASTA | Shuffled or user-provided | No | PWM | Fast successor to MEME-ChIP; tolerant of large sets | Same uracil bias issue as HOMER |
| MEME-ChIP | Peak FASTA | Markov order 1-3 | No | Multiple motifs | Wrapper for MEME + CentriMo + Tomtom comparison | Designed for ChIP; for CLIP use STREME directly |
| kpLogo | k-mer scores with positions | NA (significance from kpLogo internals) | Yes (positional) | Position-specific logo | Visualizes position-specific signal; complements PWM | Requires k-mer-score input file; not a peak-to-motif tool by itself |
| mCross (Feng 2019) | Single-nucleotide CL sites + genome | Generated internally | Yes (jointly models motif + CL position) | Registered PWM + CL offset | The standard for in vivo RBP motif registration; SRSF1 example showed clustered GGA half-sites | Requires high-quality single-nt CL sites (PureCLIP or CTK CITS) |
| PEKA (Kuret 2022) | Peaks + crosslink BED | Low-count crosslinks within same dataset | Yes (positional k-mer) | Position-enriched k-mers with significance | No external input required; cross-validates with mCross | Less granular than mCross's jointly-modeled PWM |
| RBPamp (Jens 2022) | Peak FASTA or CL sites | Joint affinity model | No (affinity-based) | Affinity-weighted motif + Kd estimate | Provides Kd; compatible with RBNS calibration | Slow; small community; needs validation |
| RCAS | Peak BED + GTF | Auto | No | Motif + region annotation | One-stop for motif + region distribution | Less granular than per-tool dedicated runs |
| MEME FIMO (motif scan) | PWM + FASTA | Markov bg | No | Match locations and scores | Scan known motifs across genome | Not a de novo tool; complements HOMER known scan |
| RBPNet (Horlacher et al 2023) | Raw sequence | Trained model | Yes (sequence-to-signal at single nt) | Predicted CL count distribution | Deep learning; predicts per-base affinity profile | See clip-seq/clip-deep-learning |

Methodology evolves; verify motif comparison databases (CISBP-RNA, ATtRACT, oRNAment, mCrossBase, RBPDB) for known motif validation. RBNS in vitro Kd values (Lambert 2014; Dominguez 2018 for 78 RBPs) are the most reliable orthogonal reference for in vivo CLIP motifs.

## Critical Choice: Peak-Based vs Crosslink-Site-Based Motif Discovery

**Peak-based (HOMER, MEME/STREME, RBPamp):** Extract sequences from peak BED, find enriched k-mers / PWMs. Produces classical motif logos. Fast and intuitive. Captures broad binding zones.

**Crosslink-site-based (mCross, PEKA, kpLogo):** Use single-nucleotide CL positions; analyze sequence in a window around each CL position. Produces motif logos REGISTERED to the CL site. Required for understanding the structural relationship between motif and crosslink.

The fundamental difference: peak-based logos show "what sequence is enriched near binding"; CL-registered logos show "what sequence the RBP contacts at the crosslink position." For most RBPs they agree on the core motif but diverge on flanking context.

## Uracil Crosslinking Bias

UV254 crosslinking is U-biased: single-nt CL events are strongly enriched at U residues (Konig 2010; Sugimoto 2012). Consequence: motif logos centered on raw CL positions are U-enriched at the center even for non-U-binding RBPs (e.g., PUM2 binds UGUANAUA but peak-center is shifted; HNRNPK binds C-rich tracts but centers can show spurious U).

**Mitigations:**
- Use peak boundaries, not single-nt CL, for HOMER/MEME (peak-level averaging dilutes the U bias).
- Use mCross or PEKA, which explicitly model the CL position offset from the motif center.
- Shuffle background should preserve mononucleotide composition (HOMER default does; MEME with `--markov-order 1` does).
- For PAR-CLIP, the bias is at U residues but T->C marks the EXACT CL position; mCross / PEKA register more cleanly than for iCLIP/eCLIP.

For naive HOMER/MEME output, examine the central column of the PWM: if it is U-skewed, suspect CL bias rather than true U preference. Cross-check against published RBNS Kd if available.

## Per-Tool Failure Modes

### HOMER -- Background mismatch inflates GC-biased motifs

**Trigger:** HOMER auto-generates a shuffled background that preserves only nucleotide frequency, not GC distribution per region; CLIP peaks come disproportionately from 3' UTRs which are AU-rich.

**Mechanism:** AU-rich foreground vs GC-shuffled background produces "AU-rich motif" as the top hit for any 3' UTR-binding RBP, regardless of biology.

**Symptom:** Top HOMER motif looks like the 3' UTR mean composition (AU-rich, no clear specificity); known motif scan (`-known`) finds the RBP's canonical motif at lower rank than the spurious "AU" motif.

**Fix:** Provide a GC-matched background: extract sequences from random 3' UTR regions of expressed transcripts matched by length distribution. Use `-bg matched_bg.fa` flag. Or use STREME with `-n matched_bg.fa`.

### MEME -- Slow on large peak sets

**Trigger:** MEME run on > 1000 peak sequences.

**Mechanism:** MEME is O(N^2) in sequence count; classical OOPS/ZOOPS/ANR models do not scale.

**Symptom:** Runtime > 12h; out-of-memory on large machines.

**Fix:** Use STREME (MEME Suite >= 5.0); it is the modern fast successor (sub-quadratic). Or restrict to top-1000 peaks by score.

### mCross -- Requires single-nt CL sites

**Trigger:** mCross run on a peak BED instead of crosslink BED.

**Mechanism:** mCross's model is `motif_PWM x CL_position_offset_PMF`. Without single-nt CL positions there is no offset axis; the model degenerates.

**Symptom:** mCross output looks identical to a peak-centered logo; the diagnostic CL-offset histogram is flat.

**Fix:** Provide CL sites from PureCLIP, CTK CITS, or PARalyzer. The Yeo lab and Zhang lab use the convention of PureCLIP CL sites as mCross input.

### PEKA -- Background from same dataset

**Trigger:** Concerned that PEKA's "low-count crosslinks within same dataset" background is biased.

**Mechanism:** PEKA does NOT need external input. It uses low-count crosslinks (below a quantile threshold) as the background and high-count crosslinks (above) as the foreground. This is by design (Kuret 2022) and cross-validated against mCross.

**Symptom:** False positive concern; user wants to verify.

**Fix:** Run BOTH PEKA and mCross; cross-validate. The PEKA paper reports high concordance with mCross for ENCODE RBPs; treat them as orthogonal confirmation.

### RBPamp -- Slow convergence

**Trigger:** Large peak set (> 5000); RBPamp jointly optimizes affinity + motif iteratively.

**Mechanism:** Joint optimization is slow; some RBPs have multimodal binding (multiple motifs) that confuse single-PWM RBPamp.

**Symptom:** Runtime > 24h; output PWM disagrees with HOMER top motif.

**Fix:** Down-sample to top-2000 peaks; or run HOMER for initial PWM and use it as RBPamp seed.

### RBNS comparison -- in vitro vs in vivo divergence

**Trigger:** Comparing CLIP-derived motif to RBNS Kd-ranked motif (Dominguez 2018) and finding divergence (e.g., CLIP top motif rank 3 in RBNS; RBNS top motif weakly enriched in CLIP).

**Mechanism:** In vivo binding is shaped by structure accessibility (RNA secondary structure), cooperativity, and competing factors. RBNS measures intrinsic affinity in vitro. They diverge for:
- Structurally regulated RBPs (PUM2, RBFOX2 favor accessible loops)
- Cooperative binders (FUS, TDP-43, SR proteins)
- Co-factor-dependent (SRSF1 paralogs)

**Symptom:** CLIP motif logo plausible but rank-3 in RBNS; or RBNS top motif missing from CLIP peaks.

**Fix:** Accept the divergence as informative. Cite both. Use SHAPE-eCLIP or icSHAPE-MaP to test structural-accessibility hypothesis. For variant-effect studies, prefer RBNS-derived PWM (RBPamp Kd) over CLIP motif for absolute affinity prediction.

### Known motif scan -- FIMO threshold too lenient

**Trigger:** Used FIMO with default `-thresh 1e-4` and got matches everywhere.

**Mechanism:** Default threshold is too lenient for in vivo binding; CLIP background sequences contain many low-affinity matches.

**Symptom:** FIMO match rate > 50% of peaks AND > 20% of random background; no enrichment signal.

**Fix:** Use `-thresh 1e-5` or `-thresh 1e-6`; or use CentriMo for local enrichment around peak center (testing positional enrichment, not threshold).

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Quick de novo motif from CLIPper peaks, ENCODE-comparable | HOMER `-rna -len 5,6,7,8` with GC-matched bg | Fast, mature, ENCODE convention |
| Motif registered to crosslink position (for variant effect) | mCross on PureCLIP single-nt sites | The 2019 Feng paper is the canonical reference |
| Confirm mCross result with independent method | PEKA on same peaks + crosslinks | Cross-validation; PEKA does not need input control |
| Affinity-weighted motif with Kd estimate | RBPamp | Provides quantitative Kd; integrates with RBNS comparison |
| Compare to in vitro RBNS Kd | RBPamp + Dominguez 2018 / Lambert 2014 tables | RBNS is the orthogonal in vitro standard |
| RBP with known motif - validation scan | FIMO -thresh 1e-5 against CISBP-RNA / ATtRACT PWM | Lower-confidence motifs need tight threshold |
| Multiple binding modes (SRSF1 GGA clusters) | mCross + manual inspection of CL-offset histogram | mCross reveals the multimodal structure |
| Position-specific logo (5' vs 3' of CL) | kpLogo with k-mer scores | Position-specific significance visualization |
| AU-rich 3' UTR binders (HuR, AUF1) - validate U bias is real | Compare HOMER motif center vs PUM2-style register | RBP-specific tradition |
| Allele-specific motif (variant effect) | mCross PWM + DeepRiPe/RBPNet for variant scoring | See clip-seq/clip-deep-learning |
| snoRNA / structural RNA - sequence motif less meaningful | Skip motif analysis; emphasize structural context (icSHAPE) | snoRNA binders read structure, not linear sequence |

## Reconciliation: When Motif Tools Disagree

| Pattern | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| HOMER and STREME agree; mCross disagrees on flanking | mCross's CL-offset registers a flanking base that's identical in peak; HOMER sees both flanking bases as motif | Trust mCross for CL-registered position; HOMER is "what's nearby" |
| Top HOMER motif AU-rich; RBP knows to bind structure | GC-matched background not used | Re-run HOMER with `-bg matched_bg.fa` |
| HOMER finds canonical motif at rank 1; RBNS Kd ranks at rank 3 | In vitro vs in vivo specificity divergence | Both valid; cite RBNS for absolute affinity, CLIP for in vivo prevalence |
| mCross PWM has multiple CL-position peaks | Multiple binding modes (SRSF1 GGA half-sites; PTBP1 multimer) | Treat as biologically meaningful; report both |
| Skipper window-level motifs differ from CLIPper peak-level | Window size dilutes signal; peak boundaries sharpen | Both valid; report at the level of the downstream analysis |
| PAR-CLIP motifs cleaner than iCLIP for same RBP | PAR-CLIP T->C registers exactly; iCLIP truncates -1 from CL | Both correct; PAR-CLIP is the sharper single-nt method when 4SU labeling tolerated |
| HOMER finds different motif on top vs bottom strand | Strand information lost in upstream BED | Verify BED column 6 (strand) is preserved; HOMER respects strand |

**Operational rule for high-confidence motif reporting:** Report (a) HOMER top de novo motif with GC-matched background, (b) mCross PWM with CL-position offset histogram, (c) PEKA k-mer enrichment for orthogonal confirmation, (d) FIMO scan against published RBP PWM (CISBP-RNA / ATtRACT) for known-motif validation, (e) RBNS Kd ranking from Dominguez 2018 if available. Three independent methods agreeing on the core motif is the bar.

## Workflow: De Novo + Known + CL-Registered

**Goal:** Produce a publication-grade motif report combining peak-based de novo discovery, CL-position-registered motif (mCross), and known-motif validation.

**Approach:** Extract sequences with strand preservation, build a GC-matched 3' UTR background, run HOMER + STREME for de novo, mCross for CL-registered, FIMO scan against CISBP-RNA, and report all three views with information-content QC.

```bash
# Step 1: Extract peak sequences (use stringent peak set: log2 FC >= 3, -log10 p >= 3)
bedtools getfasta -fi genome.fa -bed peaks.stringent.bed -s -fo peaks.fa

# Step 2: GC-matched background (random regions from expressed transcripts)
# expressed.bed = transcripts with TPM >= 1 in the same cell type
shuffleBed -i peaks.stringent.bed -g chrom.sizes -incl expressed.bed -seed 42 > shuffled.bed
bedtools getfasta -fi genome.fa -bed shuffled.bed -s -fo background.fa

# Step 3: HOMER de novo + known
findMotifs.pl peaks.fa fasta homer_out \
    -rna -len 5,6,7,8 -p 8 \
    -fasta background.fa

# Step 4: STREME for cross-validation
streme --rna --oc streme_out -p peaks.fa -n background.fa --minw 5 --maxw 10

# Step 5: mCross requires single-nt CL sites (PureCLIP output)
# crosslinks.bed = PureCLIP -o sites.bed (single-nt CL positions, see clip-seq/crosslink-site-detection)
mCross \
    -i crosslinks.bed -g genome.fa -k 7 -n 5 -o mcross_out

# Step 6: PEKA orthogonal positional k-mer
peka --peak_file_name peaks.stringent.bed --crosslinks_file_name crosslinks.bed --genome_file_name genome.fa --regions_file_name regions.bed --kmer_length 5 --percentile 30 --outpath peka_out

# Step 7: Compare to RBNS in vitro Kd (Dominguez 2018 supplementary)
# Manual cross-reference to RBNS Kd-ranked top-5 motifs for the target RBP
```

## Quality Checks

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from Bio import motifs

def parse_homer_motif(motif_file):
    '''Parse HOMER motif PWM and return information content'''
    pwm = []
    with open(motif_file) as f:
        for line in f:
            if line.startswith('>'):
                continue
            pwm.append([float(x) for x in line.strip().split()])
    pwm = np.array(pwm)
    # Information content per position (bits)
    epsilon = 1e-10
    ic = np.sum(pwm * np.log2(pwm / 0.25 + epsilon), axis=1)
    return {
        'length': pwm.shape[0],
        'mean_IC_per_position': np.mean(ic),
        'max_IC': np.max(ic),
        'min_IC': np.min(ic),
        'is_low_complexity': np.mean(ic) < 0.5
    }

# A high-quality CLIP motif has mean IC per position > 1.0 bit
# Mean IC < 0.5 suggests no real motif - check for background mismatch
```

| Metric | Good | Investigate |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Mean IC per position (HOMER PWM) | > 1.0 bit | < 0.5 = no real motif or background mismatch |
| Motif center U content | matches RBP biology | > 80% U in central position = U-CL bias suspect |
| FIMO scan rate in peaks vs background | peaks 3-10x bg | < 2x = motif too weak; > 50x = motif too narrow |
| mCross CL-offset histogram | single mode at offset N | flat = mCross unable to register |
| RBNS rank of CLIP top motif | top 3 | > 10 = strong in vivo / in vitro divergence; investigate |
| Replicate motif overlap | top motif identical in 2/2 reps | discordance = under-powered or one rep failed |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| HOMER top motif is "ATCC" or similar TruSeq-adapter-like | Adapter trim incomplete in preprocessing | Re-run cutadapt with correct adapter; verify trimming completed before peak calling |
| mCross "no crosslinks found" or output identical to peak-centered logo | Passed peak BED instead of single-nt crosslink-site BED | mCross requires PureCLIP or CTK CITS single-nt site BED; not a CLIPper peak BED. See clip-seq/crosslink-site-detection |
| mCross CL-offset histogram is flat | Strand information missing OR alignment soft-clipped 5' base | Verify BED column 6 (strand); confirm upstream `--alignEndsType EndToEnd` |
| All HOMER motifs are AU-rich, no specificity | Default shuffled background AU-rich for 3' UTR peaks | Provide GC-matched background from expressed 3' UTRs |
| mCross input "no crosslinks found" | Provided peak BED instead of single-nt CL BED | Pass PureCLIP / CTK CITS single-nt BED instead |
| MEME "out of memory" or > 12h runtime | Peak set too large | Switch to STREME; or down-sample to top-1000 peaks |
| FIMO match in nearly every peak | Threshold too lenient | Tighten to 1e-5 or 1e-6 |
| Motif width > 10 nt looks chimeric | HOMER reported overlapping co-motifs as one | Re-run with `-len 5,6,7,8` (force narrower); inspect rank 2-5 motifs |
| PWM info content < 0.5 bits | Background mismatch or peaks have no specificity | Verify peak set is stringent (log2 FC >= 3); regenerate background |
| Strand-specific motif different on +/- | BED column 6 missing or wrong | Verify strand encoding; re-extract with `bedtools getfasta -s` |
| Multiple distinct motifs per RBP | Biological (multimodal RBPs) OR contaminating multi-RBP CLIP | Validate with mCross multimode + compare to literature |
