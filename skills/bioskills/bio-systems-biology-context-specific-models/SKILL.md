name: bio-systems-biology-context-specific-models
description: Builds tissue-, cell-type-, and condition-specific metabolic models by integrating transcriptomic or proteomic data into a generic genome-scale model, using extraction algorithms (GIMME, iMAT, INIT/tINIT, MADE, E-Flux, CORDA, FASTCORE) via troppo and corda in Python or the COBRA Toolbox/RAVEN in MATLAB. Use when pruning a generic model to a context, choosing an extraction method and expression threshold, mapping expression through GPR rules to reactions, deciding whether an objective is required (GIMME vs iMAT), avoiding the growth-objective trap for non-proliferating tissue, or judging how much of a context-specific model is real signal versus an artifact of the threshold and method.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: COBRApy 0.29+, corda 0.5+, numpy 1.26+, pandas 2.2+, Python 3.10+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

Note: COBRApy core does NOT implement GIMME/iMAT/INIT. Real Python implementations live in `troppo` (multi-method) and `corda` (CORDA); the reference multi-method implementations are the MATLAB COBRA Toolbox `createTissueSpecificModel` and RAVEN (INIT/tINIT). Do not expect a `cobra.flux_analysis.gimme()`; it does not exist.

# Context-Specific Models

**"Build a liver-specific metabolic model from my expression data"** -> Prune/constrain a generic genome-scale model to the reactions an extraction algorithm judges active in that context, given omics data mapped through GPR rules and a threshold.
- Python: `corda.CORDA` (CORDA), `troppo` (GIMME/iMAT/tINIT/FASTCORE/CORDA); MATLAB: COBRA Toolbox `createTissueSpecificModel`, RAVEN (COBRApy for downstream FBA)

## The governing principle: the threshold and method are the experiment, not the data

Two facts govern every context-specific model:

- Expression is NOT flux. A highly transcribed gene need not carry high flux (post-transcriptional regulation, allostery, kinetics decouple mRNA from enzyme activity), and an absent transcript does not prove its reaction is off. Absence is a moderately strong constraint; presence is a weak one. mRNA -> enzyme -> flux is a lossy chain, and every extraction method encodes a DIFFERENT guess about that chain.
- Method choice and thresholding dominate the result more than the biology does. Systematic evaluations found that no extraction method reliably beats the others, and that expression-integration methods often fail to beat parsimonious FBA, which uses NO expression at all; the choice of method x threshold x objective changes the model content MORE than the input data does (Machado & Herrgard 2014; Opdam 2017; Richelle 2019). The single on/off threshold is the highest-leverage hidden decision. Consequence: report the method, the threshold strategy, and the objective as first-class methods, and treat a reaction whose inclusion flips with a plausible threshold change as a hypothesis, not a finding.

A corollary trap: GIMME-family methods require a protected objective (usually biomass). For a differentiated, non-proliferating tissue (hepatocyte, neuron), forcing a growth objective is a category error - those cells are not making copies of themselves. Use an objective-free method (iMAT) or a task-based one (tINIT) for non-growing tissue, or define a genuine maintenance/functional task instead of biomass.

## Decision: which extraction method

| Method | Objective/task required? | Expression handling | Best implementation | When |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------|
| GIMME (Becker & Palsson 2008) | Yes (biomass/task) | discrete threshold; penalize below-threshold flux | troppo (Py); COBRA Toolbox (MATLAB) | proliferating cells with a real objective |
| iMAT (Shlomi 2008; Zur 2010) | No | discrete high/low buckets (MILP) | troppo (Py); COBRA Toolbox (MATLAB) | non-growing human tissue; the common default |
| INIT / tINIT (Agren 2012/2014) | tINIT: metabolic TASKS | protein/HPA evidence + net accumulation | RAVEN (MATLAB) | task-guaranteed, functional tissue models |
| MADE (Jensen & Papin 2011) | No | differential significance, no absolute threshold; needs >=2 conditions | MATLAB (TIGER) | comparative/time-course designs |
| E-Flux (Colijn 2009) | No | expression sets continuous flux BOUNDS (no discretization) | custom (simple) | quick continuous constraint; no on/off decision |
| CORDA (Schultz & Qutub 2016) | No | 5 confidence classes; dependency-rescued | corda (Python, turnkey) | cancer/tissue models; "concise not minimal" |
| FASTCORE (Vlassis 2014) | core reaction set | core + minimal consistent extension | troppo (Py); COBRA Toolbox | fast, compact, given a trusted core |

Honest tooling reality: the most complete, best-validated implementations are MATLAB (COBRA Toolbox / RAVEN). In Python, `troppo` is the multi-method option and `corda` is the most turnkey native implementation. Steering a user to "just use COBRApy" for iMAT/GIMME sends them into reimplementing an algorithm.

## Map Expression Through GPR Rules

**Goal:** Convert per-gene expression into a per-reaction activity score that respects enzyme logic.

**Approach:** Evaluate the GPR with min for AND (a complex is limited by its scarcest subunit) and max for OR (any isozyme suffices). This min/max convention is standard but lossy - it discards the quantitative contribution of all but the limiting/dominant gene.

```python
def reaction_activity(rxn, gene_expr, default=0.0):
    '''Aggregate gene expression to a reaction score: min over AND (complex), max over OR (isozyme).'''
    if not rxn.genes:
        return default
    values = [gene_expr.get(g.id, default) for g in rxn.genes]
    return max(values)   # simplified OR; a full parser applies min within each AND-clause first
```

## CORDA in Python (a real, turnkey extraction method)

**Goal:** Reconstruct a context-specific model that keeps as many high-confidence reactions as possible while excluding absent ones, rescuing reactions that high-confidence ones depend on.

**Approach:** Translate expression into CORDA's five confidence classes (-1 absent, 0 unknown, 1 low, 2 medium, 3 high) via the GPR, then let CORDA build a "concise but not minimal" model.

```python
from corda import CORDA, reaction_confidence

# gene_conf maps gene id -> confidence in {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3}; derive it from expression quantiles.
gene_conf = {g.id: 2 for g in model.genes}
rxn_conf = {r.id: reaction_confidence(r, gene_conf) for r in model.reactions}   # pass the Reaction, not its GPR string

opt = CORDA(model, rxn_conf)
opt.build()
context_model = opt.cobra_model('liver')   # verify the exact accessor for the installed corda version
```

## Conceptual GIMME-Style Constraint (illustration only)

**Goal:** Show the objective-protected pruning idea GIMME encodes, for teaching - not as a substitute for a validated implementation.

**Approach:** Require the objective to stay above a floor, then penalize/limit flux through reactions whose genes are all below the expression threshold. A faithful GIMME solves a single LP with an inconsistency score; this stub only illustrates the shape and must not be reported as GIMME output.

```python
import numpy as np

def gimme_style_stub(model, gene_expr, low_quantile=0.25, growth_floor=0.1):
    '''Illustrative only. For real GIMME/iMAT use troppo or the COBRA Toolbox.'''
    cutoff = np.quantile(list(gene_expr.values()), low_quantile)
    low = {g for g, v in gene_expr.items() if v < cutoff}
    ctx = model.copy()
    biomass = str(model.objective.expression).split('*')[1].split()[0]
    ctx.reactions.get_by_id(biomass).lower_bound = growth_floor   # protect the objective
    for rxn in ctx.reactions:
        genes = {g.id for g in rxn.genes}
        if genes and genes <= low:
            rxn.bounds = (max(rxn.lower_bound, -1.0), min(rxn.upper_bound, 1.0))
    return ctx
```

## Thresholding: the make-or-break decision

```python
# The single on/off threshold moves the model more than the algorithm does. Options:
#  - Global: one cutoff across all genes/samples (simple; ignores gene-specific expression ranges).
#  - Local: a per-gene cutoff (e.g. a gene is "on" relative to its own distribution across samples).
#  - StanDep (Joshi 2020): clusters genes by expression pattern and thresholds per cluster; captures
#    housekeeping vs peaky genes that a single global cutoff mishandles.
# Always run a sensitivity check: rebuild at 2-3 thresholds and report which reactions/pathways are
# stable vs threshold-dependent. Report proteomics-derived scores separately; protein is closer to
# flux capacity than mRNA but still not flux.
#  - Single-cell input: scRNA-seq zeros are dominated by technical DROPOUT, which inverts the
#    "absence is a strong constraint" logic (a zero may be an unobserved, not an absent, transcript).
#    Aggregate to pseudobulk or metacells PER CELL TYPE before extraction (or use a single-cell-native
#    method); do not threshold individual cells. See single-cell/cell-annotation.
```

## Common Errors

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `AttributeError: cobra.flux_analysis has no gimme` | COBRApy ships no GIMME/iMAT/INIT | use troppo/corda (Python) or COBRA Toolbox/RAVEN (MATLAB) |
| Context model of a neuron/hepatocyte cannot satisfy biomass | GIMME-family objective forced on non-proliferating tissue | use iMAT (objective-free) or tINIT (task-based); do not protect biomass |
| Two analysts get different tissue models from the same data | threshold/method/objective differ | fix and report all three; run a threshold sensitivity sweep |
| Reaction present in data but pruned out | presence is a weak signal; the method judged it inactive in context | expected; do not over-trust presence, and check the GPR aggregation |
| Absent transcript but reaction kept | absence is only a moderate constraint; a dependency rescued it (CORDA) | inspect `opt.redundancies`/dependency rescue; decide if the rescue is justified |
| Model predicts overflow/Warburg poorly | expression pruning has no enzyme-capacity budget | use enzyme-constrained models (GECKO/sMOMENT) with proteomics |
