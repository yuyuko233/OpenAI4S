description: Calls ChIP-seq peaks with MACS3, MACS2, HOMER, or SPP across narrow (TF) and broad (histone) modes. Handles input control matching, fragment-size modeling vs --nomodel, effective genome size, ENCODE-style IDR vs naive overlap, hyper-ChIPable artifacts, and aligner-specific shifts. Use when calling peaks from ChIP-seq alignments, choosing between narrow vs broad mode for a histone mark, deciding model vs nomodel for low-depth data, applying ENCODE pseudoreplicate IDR, or reconciling MACS vs HOMER vs SPP results.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: MACS3 3.0.4+, MACS2 2.2.9+, HOMER 4.11+, SPP 1.16+, samtools 1.19+, bedtools 2.31+, IDR 2.0.4+.

Before running, verify versions: `<tool> --version` and `<tool> --help` to confirm flags. If a flag is missing, check the changelog — MACS2->MACS3 is API-compatible for `callpeak` but `predictd`, `bdgpeakcall`, and `hmmratac` differ.

# ChIP-seq Peak Calling

**"Identify protein-DNA binding sites from ChIP-seq alignments"** -> Detect statistically enriched genomic regions by comparing IP signal to input control (or genomic background), with peak shape (narrow/broad) determined by target biology (TF vs histone mark).

- CLI (ENCODE TF default): `macs2 callpeak -t chip.bam -c input.bam -f BAM -g hs -n sample --keep-dup all -p 1e-2`
- CLI (ENCODE histone default): same with `--broad --broad-cutoff 0.1` for H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3
- CLI (alternative): `macs3 callpeak ...` (API-identical, active development), HOMER `findPeaks tags/ -style histone -i input_tags/`, SPP via phantompeakqualtools wrapper

ENCODE TF pipeline still uses **SPP for peak ranking + IDR**, with MACS2 producing the signal tracks. Histone pipeline uses **MACS2 + naive overlap** (IDR is too conservative for histone signal dynamic range). MACS3 is the actively maintained successor; MACS2 receives only bug fixes.

## Critical Pre-Call Validation

Before any peak calling, three things must be true or the output is unreliable:

1. **Antibody validated** — KO/KD orthogonal control, peptide-array specificity for histone modifications, or vendor-provided CRISPR-validated lot (Epicypher, CST). "ChIP-grade" marketing is not validation. See chipseq-qc.
2. **Fragment-size distribution is sane** — TF ChIP should show sub-nucleosomal (~50-100 bp) enrichment; histone ChIP should show clean mono- (~150) and di-nucleosomal (~300) peaks. Flat distribution = over-sonication; rescue is impossible. Check via `samtools view -f 0x2 sample.bam | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq -c`.
3. **Input control matches** — Sonicated input is biased toward open chromatin; MNase input toward nucleosomes. Input from a different library prep batch or fragmentation method introduces bias that subtraction cannot fix.

## Algorithmic Taxonomy

| Tool | Model | Treats fragments as | Strength | Fails when |
|------|-------|---------------------|----------|------------|
| MACS3/MACS2 callpeak | Dynamic local Poisson (max of genome-wide, 1kb, 5kb, 10kb lambda) + BH-FDR | Single-end shifts; PE fragments via BAMPE | Mature, fast, ENCODE-default, narrow + broad modes, integrated signal tracks | Confounds NFR with broad accessible domains; default narrow mode segments broad enrichment; assumes most genome NOT enriched (breaks for genome-wide marks) |
| SPP (Kharchenko 2008) | Strand cross-correlation peak detection + Poisson fold-enrichment | Single-end with cross-corr-derived shift | ENCODE TF caller; integrated NSC/RSC QC; robust for sharp TF peaks | Underperforms for broad marks; older R codebase; phantompeakqualtools wrapper has R-version compatibility issues |
| HOMER `-style factor` | Fixed-width peaks + three sequential filters (control / local / clonal) | Tag positions; auto-estimated width | Fast on tag directories; clonal filter `-C` removes PCR-artifact peaks | Less calibrated p-values; fixed width clips variable-width factor binding |
| HOMER `-style histone` | Variable-width region stitching (500 bp blocks, 1000 bp gap merging); L=0 (no local enrichment) | Tag positions | Captures variable-width histone enrichment; Omnipeak benchmark (Shpynov & Artyomov 2026): outperforms `-style factor` for histone marks including H3K4me3 | Less sensitive than MACS for very sharp TF binding |
| Genrich `-y` (ChIP mode) | q-value on log-transformed p-value, joint replicate model | Whole fragments (PE intervals) | Joint replicate analysis; chrM exclusion via `-e chrM`; auto blacklist via `-E` | Less peer-reviewed than MACS/SPP; thin literature; control handling less mature |
| MACS3 hmmratac | 3-state HMM on fragment-size signal | Fragment-size classes | Best for ATAC, not ChIP | Wrong tool for ChIP; ChIP fragment-size distribution doesn't drive useful HMM states |
| SEACR (Meers 2019) | Empirical threshold on signal block totals | Bedgraph signal blocks | Designed for sparse CUT&RUN/CUT&Tag data; "stringent" mode with IgG strongly preferred | Not for traditional ChIP-seq (assumes near-zero background); see cut-and-run-tag |
| LanceOtron (Hentges 2022) | CNN trained on ENCODE peaks | bigWig signal | Competitive for both narrow and broad without parameter tuning | Newer; less validated; web-only or pip install |

For CUT&RUN / CUT&Tag specifically, see chip-seq/cut-and-run-tag — protocol differences (lower depth, IgG-only control, E. coli spike-in carryover) drive different caller choice (MACS2 + SEACR consensus, not MACS3 alone).

## Decision: Narrow vs Broad

Driven by target biology, not preference. Calling broad mode does not make a sharp signal broad; it changes how MACS stitches adjacent enrichment.

| Target | Mode | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| Transcription factors (CTCF, p53, GATA1, FOXA1) | Narrow (default) | Discrete motif binding produces sharp peaks |
| H3K4me3, H3K27ac at promoters/enhancers | Narrow | Localized at regulatory elements |
| H3K4me1 at enhancers | Narrow or broad-cutoff 0.1 | Variable; check published data for the cell type |
| H3K36me3, H3K79me2 (elongation) | Broad | Deposited across active gene bodies (5-50 kb domains) |
| H3K27me3, H3K9me3 (repressive) | Broad | Spread across 10-100+ kb domains |
| H4K20me3 (constitutive het) | Broad | Heterochromatin domains |
| Pol II (RNAPII) | Narrow at promoter + broad option for elongation profile | Two separate analyses if doing elongation biology |

For HOMER: use `-style histone` for ALL histone marks (Omnipeak benchmark, Shpynov & Artyomov 2026 NAR 54:gkaf1454); `-style factor` ONLY for transcription factors.

## Decision: Model vs --nomodel

MACS2/3 fragment-size modeling needs ≥100 paired plus/minus enrichment regions within `--mfold` (default `[5, 50]`). Silent failure produces wrong fragment size and warped peaks — always inspect `_model.r` output.

| Condition | Model? | Fallback |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Whole-genome, ≥1M treatment reads, narrow TF | Yes | `--mfold 3 50` if fails |
| Paired-end with `-f BAMPE` | N/A | Fragment size from mate pairs |
| Single chromosome or targeted capture | No | `--nomodel --extsize <data-derived or mark default>` |
| Low read count (<500k) | No | Same |
| Broad histone mark | Either | Mark-type default if no estimate available |

When `--nomodel` is required, choose `--extsize` in priority order: (1) cross-correlation estimate from phantompeakqualtools (ENCODE standard, gives NSC/RSC simultaneously); (2) `macs3 predictd -i chip.bam -g hs` and read stderr; (3) mark-type fallback (147 for nucleosome-proximal marks, 200 for broader marks).

## Effective Genome Size — Often Wrong, Always Matters

`-g hs` (2.7e9) and `-g mm` (1.87e9) are decade-old approximations. Modern read-length-matched values (deepTools `effectiveGenomeSize` table):

| Genome | Read length | Effective size |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| hg38 | 50 bp | 2.701e9 |
| hg38 | 75 bp | 2.748e9 |
| hg38 | 100 bp | 2.806e9 |
| hg38 | 150 bp | 2.862e9 |
| mm10 | 50 bp | 2.308e9 |
| mm10 | 100 bp | 2.467e9 |

Wrong size shifts every q-value but rarely peak ranks. For subset data (single chromosome, targeted), provide numeric `-g <bp>`; the shorthand inflates lambda_BG by 60× and produces false positives at low-signal regions.

## Hyper-ChIPable Regions Are a Persistent Artifact

Teytelman 2013 (PNAS) and Park 2013 (PLoS One) demonstrated that highly-transcribed genes (rRNA, tRNA, histone gene cluster, snoRNA hosts, mitochondrial-encoded genes, abundant housekeeping loci) appear "bound" in ChIP-seq with untagged GFP, no antibody, or non-existent targets. ENCODE blacklist v2 catches repeat-driven artifacts but NOT these hyper-ChIPable transcribed regions.

Always interpret peaks at rRNA loci, tRNA clusters, replication-dependent histone genes (HIST1/2 clusters), mitochondrial DNA, and the top-1% input-signal regions with skepticism. For rigorous claims: (1) require motif enrichment at the peak (artifact has no motif); (2) require KO/KD signal loss; (3) build a cell-type-specific blacklist from the top 1% of input signal and intersect-out.

## Pipeline Reference: ENCODE TF vs Histone

**TF pipeline (uses SPP for peak ranking):**

```bash
# Per-replicate (loose) — IDR tightens downstream
macs2 callpeak -t rep1.tagAlign.gz -c input.tagAlign.gz \
    -f BED -g hs -n rep1 \
    --nomodel --shift 0 --extsize {fraglen_from_xcor} \
    --keep-dup all -B --SPMR -p 1e-2

# Repeat for rep2, pooled, and pseudoreplicates (split each rep into halves)
# Score peaks by signalValue, sort, run IDR (see Replicate Handling below)
```

**Histone pipeline (uses MACS2 broad / narrow + naive overlap):**

```bash
# Broad marks: H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3
macs2 callpeak -t rep1.tagAlign.gz -c input.tagAlign.gz \
    -f BED -g hs -n rep1 \
    --broad --broad-cutoff 0.1 \
    --nomodel --shift 0 --extsize {fraglen} \
    --keep-dup all -B --SPMR -p 1e-2

# Naive overlap: a peak passes if it appears in ≥2 of N replicates
# with ≥40% reciprocal overlap (ENCODE default, often misquoted as 50%)
bedtools intersect -a rep1.broadPeak -b rep2.broadPeak -f 0.40 -r -u > naive_overlap.bed
```

`--keep-dup all` is intentional in the ENCODE pattern: duplicates were already filtered upstream by MarkDuplicates + `samtools view -F 1804 -q 30`. `-p 1e-2` is permissive because IDR (TF) or overlap (histone) tightens downstream.

## Replicate Handling: IDR vs Naive Overlap

ENCODE rules (Landt 2012 *Genome Res*):

**TFs use IDR.** Run on signal-ranked peaks (sort by `-k8,8nr` p-value; `-k7,7nr` signal works for SPP but breaks for MACS pile-up if libraries differ).

```bash
sort -k8,8nr rep1.narrowPeak > rep1.sorted
sort -k8,8nr rep2.narrowPeak > rep2.sorted

idr --samples rep1.sorted rep2.sorted \
    --input-file-type narrowPeak --rank p.value \
    --idr-threshold 0.05 --output-file true_reps.idr --plot
```

**ENCODE Nself/Nt consistency rule** (often misremembered):
- Nt = IDR-passing peaks across true biological replicates (threshold 0.05)
- Nself (per rep) = IDR-passing peaks across pseudoreplicates of one library (threshold 0.10)
- Library passes if `max(N1self, N2self) / min(N1self, N2self) ≤ 2` AND `max(Nt, max(Nself)) / min(Nt, min(Nself)) ≤ 2`
- Both ratios > 2: library rejected

**Histones use naive overlap.** IDR's high-vs-low-rank assumption breaks for histone dynamic range. Naive overlap: pool peaks, require each to appear in ≥2 replicates with ≥40% reciprocal overlap.

## ENCODE 3 vs ENCODE 4 Differences

| Feature | ENCODE 3 | ENCODE 4 |
|---------|----------|----------|
| TF peak ranker | SPP | SPP (unchanged) |
| Histone caller | MACS2 | MACS2 (MACS3 not yet adopted) |
| Aligner | bwa-mem | bwa-mem (chromap evaluated; not yet swapped) |
| Blacklist | v1 (ENCODE DAC, unpublished resource) | v2 (Amemiya 2019) |
| TF significance | `-p 1e-2` + IDR @ 0.05 | Same |
| Histone significance | `-p 1e-2` + naive overlap | Same |
| Effective genome size | `hs`/`mm` shorthand | deepTools read-length-tabulated |
| Pseudoreplicate IDR threshold | 0.10 self-consistency | 0.10 self-consistency |

ENCODE 4 outputs are NOT numerically comparable to ENCODE 3 on the same BAM (blacklist change + genome size update shift peak counts ~3-10%).

## Per-Tool Failure Modes

### MACS2/3 -- Silent fragment-size model failure

**Trigger:** Sparse signal, low replicate depth, or saturated samples; `_model.r` plot never inspected.

**Mechanism:** Model needs ≥100 paired plus/minus enriched regions in `--mfold` range. Below threshold, MACS picks an arbitrary fragment size (often 50 or 1000 bp), producing miscentered or oversized peaks. Stderr shows a warning that gets ignored.

**Symptom:** Peak summits shifted relative to known motif positions by hundreds of bp; visual inspection in IGV shows peaks displaced from pile-up centers.

**Fix:** Inspect `<sample>_model.r` — if peaks look reasonable, accept; if degenerate, widen with `--mfold 3 50` or switch to `--nomodel --extsize <data-derived>`. For consistency across samples in a study, always use `--nomodel --extsize {fraglen}` with cross-correlation-derived fraglen (ENCODE pattern).

### MACS2/3 -- Confounded narrow vs broad on intermediate marks

**Trigger:** Marks of intermediate breadth (H3K4me1, H3K9ac) called with default narrow mode.

**Mechanism:** Default narrow mode fragments wide enrichment into multiple sub-peaks; `--broad` over-stitches.

**Symptom:** Peak count 3-5× higher than published for same cell type; mean peak width < 200 bp at known enhancer regions.

**Fix:** For H3K4me1, try `--broad --broad-cutoff 0.1` and compare; for H3K9ac, narrow mode typically OK. Always cross-reference published peak counts for the cell type and antibody lot.

### MACS2/3 -- `--call-summits` double-counts

**Trigger:** Narrow mode + `--call-summits` flag.

**Mechanism:** MACS adds sub-peak summits at multi-mode pile-ups; broad-shouldered peaks get split into 2-3 entries.

**Symptom:** Peak count inflated; same genomic region appears as 2-3 adjacent peaks in narrowPeak output.

**Fix:** Drop `--call-summits` unless deliberately analyzing multi-mode binding (rare); merge `bedtools merge -d 200` if needed post-hoc.

### HOMER -- Wrong style for histones

**Trigger:** `-style factor` used for histone marks.

**Mechanism:** Factor mode uses fixed-width peaks with local enrichment filter `-L 4` that eliminates broad signal.

**Symptom:** Far fewer peaks than expected for H3K4me3/H3K27ac/H3K27me3; missed enrichment at known regions.

**Fix:** Use `-style histone` for ALL histone marks (Omnipeak benchmark, Shpynov & Artyomov 2026); reserve `-style factor` for TFs only.

### SPP / phantompeakqualtools -- R version incompatibility

**Trigger:** Running phantompeakqualtools wrapper script with R ≥ 4.0.

**Mechanism:** spp R package has unmaintained dependencies; some functions silently fail or return NaN for NSC/RSC.

**Fix:** Use conda env pinned to R 3.6 + spp 1.16; or use kundajelab/phantompeakqualtools fork (current); or substitute deepTools plotFingerprint for QC and MACS-derived fragment length.

### chromap aligner -- Pre-applied shift double-counts

**Trigger:** Using chromap (fast aligner) output as MACS input with `--shift -75 --extsize 150`.

**Mechanism:** chromap pre-applies a Tn5/cut-site shift before fragment output (designed for ATAC); ChIP cut-site reasoning doesn't apply but the shift still happens silently.

**Symptom:** Peaks shifted ~5-10 bp from bwa-mem output at the same locus.

**Fix:** When using chromap, drop downstream shift OR use chromap's `--no-correction`. For ChIP, bwa-mem or bowtie2 are safer defaults until ENCODE switches.

## Reconciliation: When Callers Disagree

| Pattern | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| MACS finds peak; HOMER misses | HOMER local-enrichment filter (`-L 4`) removed it at low-signal regions; or `-style factor` clipped a histone peak | Re-run HOMER with `-style histone -L 0` for histones; if persists, trust MACS |
| HOMER finds peak; MACS misses | Clonal filter `-C 2` retained PCR artifact peaks; or HOMER's auto-width captured something MACS narrow mode segmented | Check if MACS broad mode rescues; check IGV for visual confirmation |
| SPP and MACS narrow peaks differ by 10-50 bp summit | Different fragment-size estimates (SPP uses cross-corr; MACS models from data) | Use same fragment size for both: ENCODE pattern `--nomodel --extsize {xcor_fraglen}` |
| MACS narrow + MACS broad on same data: 10× peak count difference | Expected — broad mode stitches subpeaks within 1 kb gap | Use narrow for differential analysis (consistent units); broad for domain annotation |
| Per-rep MACS calls peak; pooled MACS does not | One replicate dominates; pooling smooths local lambda | Trust pooled + IDR over per-replicate counts |
| Replicate count differs >2× | One replicate failed | Check FRiP, NSC, library complexity per replicate; do NOT average — drop the failing replicate or repeat |

**Operational rule for publication-grade:** TFs require IDR ≤ 0.05 on true reps AND Nt/Nself ratios ≤ 2. Histones require naive overlap ≥2 reps with ≥40% reciprocal overlap. Both require FRiP, NSC, RSC, and library complexity thresholds met. See chipseq-qc.

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| 0 peaks called | Wrong genome size on subset data; wrong `-f` for input format; swapped treatment/control | Provide numeric `-g`; match `-f` to file type (BAM/BAMPE/BED); verify `-t` is enriched sample |
| Peak count >> 500k | Did not deduplicate; chrM not removed; `-q` too loose; hyper-ChIPable artifacts dominate | Filter `samtools view -F 1804 -q 30`; remove chrM; tighten to `-q 0.01`; blacklist top-1% input regions |
| Peaks shifted from motif by ~75 bp | `--shift` not set for `-f BAM`; or fragment-size model wrong | Add `--shift 0 --extsize {fraglen}`; or check `_model.r` |
| `--shift/--extsize ignored` warning | Used `-f BAMPE` with these flags | Switch to `-f BAM` for ENCODE pattern, or accept that BAMPE uses true fragment spans |
| IDR returns 0 reproducible peaks | Sorted by wrong column; ranks effectively random | `sort -k8,8nr` (p-value descending) on each peakset |
| Naive overlap returns few peaks | Set `-f 0.5 -r` (50% reciprocal) — too strict | Use `-f 0.40 -r` (ENCODE default) |
| FRiP < 1% | Bad ChIP (antibody, fragmentation, depth); peaks called on noise | Re-validate antibody with KO/KD; check fragment-size distribution; do not proceed |
