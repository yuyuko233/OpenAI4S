name: bio-proteomics-data-import
description: Loads mass-spectrometry data into Python/R and strips the search engine's bookkeeping before any number is trusted -- removes decoys (REV__/Reverse), contaminants (CON__/Potential contaminant), Only-identified-by-site groups, and resolves semicolon razor/leading protein-ID ambiguity in MaxQuant proteinGroups.txt, DIA-NN report.parquet, and mzML/mzXML. Distinguishes Intensity (raw) vs LFQ intensity (MaxLFQ) vs iBAQ, treats a MaxQuant zero as missing (NaN, not log2(-inf)), and inherits the acquisition mode's missingness contract (DDA MNAR vs DIA MCAR). Use when starting an analysis from raw spectra or a search engine output. Downstream normalization and stats are differential-abundance; reporter-ion/MaxLFQ quant is quantification; protein grouping is protein-inference.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: pyOpenMS 3.1+, pandas 2.2+, numpy 1.26+, MSnbase 2.28+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Mass Spectrometry Data Import -- Inheriting the Acquisition Contract and Stripping the Bookkeeping

**"Load my mass spec data into Python"** -> Parse spectra or a search-engine table AND immediately enforce two contracts -- which quant column carries real biology, and which rows are search-engine bookkeeping that must be deleted -- because the same proteinGroups.txt yields different conclusions depending on the column read and the rows kept.
- Python: `pyopenms.MzMLFile().load(path, exp)` for raw spectra; `pandas.read_csv(sep='\t')` for MaxQuant; `pandas.read_parquet` for DIA-NN
- R: `Spectra::Spectra()` / `QFeatures::readQFeatures()` for raw and quantified data (MSnbase still works but is in maintenance mode)

Scope: this skill owns reading spectra/search outputs into memory, deleting decoy/contaminant/site-only rows, picking the correct quant column, and characterizing missingness. Format conversion (RAW -> mzML) -> peptide-identification. MaxLFQ/TMT reporter quant computation -> quantification. Protein-group parsimony -> protein-inference. Normalization and imputation -> differential-abundance and expression-matrix/normalization. OUT OF SCOPE: statistical testing, batch correction, and the actual imputation step (this skill only diagnoses the missingness so the right imputer is chosen later).

## The Single Most Important Modern Insight -- Import Is Where Two Contracts Are Read and Enforced

1. **A "data import" is never just file parsing -- it is the moment the acquisition mode's quantitative contract and its missingness structure are inherited.** DDA selects the top-N most intense precursors per cycle, and which precursors get picked is partly stochastic and abundance-biased, so the same low-abundance peptide is sampled in run A and missed in run B; this manufactures structured, left-censored MNAR missingness. DIA fragments every precursor in every window every cycle, so its (fewer) missing values are closer to MCAR. The catastrophic error this prevents: imputing a DDA matrix with a mean/KNN method that assumes MCAR, which biases low-abundance proteins upward and manufactures false hits. The mode is born at acquisition and inherited at import; the missingness diagnosis made here dictates which imputation is even legitimate downstream.

2. **The search engine's bookkeeping must be stripped before any number is trusted.** A proteinGroups.txt carries decoy rows (`Reverse == '+'`, `REV__` prefix in the ID) from the target-decoy FDR machinery, contaminant rows (`Potential contaminant == '+'`, `CON__` prefix), and Only-identified-by-site rows (the protein has no unmodified-peptide evidence, only a modified site). Keeping any of these leaks non-biological signal into the intensity matrix and inflates IDs. The catastrophic error: reporting differential abundance on a matrix where decoy or keratin rows survived.

3. **The same proteinGroups.txt yields different biology from different columns, and a zero is not a measurement.** `Intensity` is raw summed precursor signal (not normalized, not comparable across samples for ratios). `LFQ intensity` is MaxLFQ-normalized and is the column for between-sample comparison. `iBAQ` is intensity divided by the number of observable tryptic peptides -- a within-sample molar proxy, not a between-sample quant. MaxQuant writes 0 for "not quantified", so log2(0) = -inf; replace 0 -> NaN before any transform. The catastrophic error: log2-transforming raw `Intensity` (or iBAQ) and reading the ratios as biology.

## Tool Taxonomy

| Tool / method | Citation | Mechanism / role | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| pyOpenMS `MzMLFile().load` | Chambers 2012 (ProteoWizard lineage) | Loads mzML/mzXML into an MSExperiment in memory; iterate spectra by MS level | Programmatic access to raw peaks, precursor m/z, isolation windows |
| pandas `read_csv`/`read_parquet` | -- | Tabular ingest of MaxQuant TSV and DIA-NN parquet | All search-engine output tables |
| DIA-NN report | Demichev 2020 | Long-format precursor table; `report.parquet` is the default (1.9+) and the only default (2.0) | DIA quant; pivot on `PG.MaxLFQ` after q-filtering |
| MaxQuant `txt/` outputs | Cox 2014 (MaxLFQ) | `proteinGroups.txt` (group level), `evidence.txt` (per-PSM) | DDA label-free / TMT search results |
| Spectra + QFeatures (R) | -- | Current Bioconductor raw + quantified-feature containers; `readQFeatures`, `aggregateFeatures` | R pipelines; preferred over MSnbase going forward |
| MSnbase `readMSData` (R) | -- | On-disk raw reading; maintenance mode (route OUT to Spectra/QFeatures) | Legacy R code only |
| ThermoRawFileParser / msconvert | Hulstaert 2020 / Chambers 2012 | RAW -> mzML conversion (route OUT) | File conversion is peptide-identification |

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|---|---|---|
| MaxQuant DDA label-free, between-sample comparison | Read `LFQ intensity` columns from proteinGroups.txt | MaxLFQ-normalized; the only MaxQuant column valid for cross-sample ratios |
| MaxQuant, absolute/molar abundance within one sample | Read `iBAQ` columns | iBAQ is a within-sample molar proxy; do not use across samples |
| Need raw uncorrected signal for a custom normalization | Read `Intensity` columns, normalize yourself | `Intensity` is raw summed precursor area, not comparable as-is |
| DIA-NN output (1.9 or 2.0) | `pd.read_parquet('report.parquet')`, filter q-values, pivot `PG.MaxLFQ` | 2.0 dropped the TSV default; q-filter before pivot or low-confidence rows leak in |
| Raw spectra, need peaks/precursor/isolation window | pyOpenMS `MzMLFile().load` | Programmatic peak and isolation-window access for QC and co-isolation reasoning |
| R-based pipeline, quantified features | QFeatures `readQFeatures` + `aggregateFeatures` | Current Bioconductor; MSnbase is maintenance-only |
| Data came from DDA, planning imputation | Diagnose missingness as MNAR -> route to left-censored imputation | DDA top-N sampling makes missingness abundance-dependent |
| Data came from DIA, planning imputation | Treat missingness as closer to MCAR | DIA samples every precursor every cycle |

Default when uncertain: read `LFQ intensity` (MaxQuant) or `PG.MaxLFQ` after q-filtering (DIA-NN), strip Reverse/contaminant/site-only rows, set 0 -> NaN, then diagnose missingness before choosing an imputer.

## Loading mzML/mzXML with pyOpenMS

**Goal:** Parse raw spectra into memory for QC, peak access, and isolation-window reasoning.

**Approach:** Load into an MSExperiment (filled in place), iterate by MS level; `get_peaks()` returns a tuple of (mz, intensity) numpy arrays, and `getPrecursors()` returns a list.

```python
from pyopenms import MSExperiment, MzMLFile

exp = MSExperiment()
MzMLFile().load('sample.mzML', exp)  # fills exp in place; returns None

for spectrum in exp:
    if spectrum.getMSLevel() == 1:
        mz, intensity = spectrum.get_peaks()  # tuple of two numpy arrays
    elif spectrum.getMSLevel() == 2:
        precursor = spectrum.getPrecursors()[0]  # getPrecursors returns a list
        precursor_mz = precursor.getMZ()
        window = precursor.getIsolationWindowLowerOffset() + precursor.getIsolationWindowUpperOffset()
```

## Loading and Cleaning MaxQuant proteinGroups.txt

**Goal:** Get a trustworthy log2 intensity matrix with bookkeeping rows removed and missing values represented as NaN.

**Approach:** Strip Reverse/contaminant/site-only rows, resolve the semicolon protein-ID list to a leading ID, pick `LFQ intensity` columns, set 0 -> NaN, then log2-transform.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

pg = pd.read_csv('proteinGroups.txt', sep='\t', low_memory=False)  # mixed-type cols

# Flag columns hold '+' or empty string; all three are proteinGroups-only bookkeeping
mask = (pg.get('Reverse', '') != '+') & (pg.get('Potential contaminant', '') != '+') & (pg.get('Only identified by site', '') != '+')
pg = pg[mask].copy()

# Protein IDs / Majority protein IDs / Gene names are SEMICOLON lists; take the first (leading/razor) entry
pg['leading_protein'] = pg['Protein IDs'].str.split(';').str[0]
pg['leading_gene'] = pg['Gene names'].where(pg['Gene names'].notna(), '').str.split(';').str[0]

lfq_cols = [c for c in pg.columns if c.startswith('LFQ intensity ')]  # MaxLFQ-normalized, between-sample comparable
matrix = pg[['leading_protein', 'leading_gene'] + lfq_cols].copy()
matrix[lfq_cols] = matrix[lfq_cols].replace(0, np.nan)  # MaxQuant writes 0 for missing; log2(0) = -inf
matrix[lfq_cols] = np.log2(matrix[lfq_cols])
```

## Loading DIA-NN report.parquet

**Goal:** Reshape the long DIA-NN report into a confident protein-by-run matrix.

**Approach:** Read the parquet (default since 1.9, only default in 2.0), filter precursor- AND protein-group q-values to 1% FDR BEFORE pivoting on `PG.MaxLFQ`.

```python
import pandas as pd

report = pd.read_parquet('report.parquet')  # report.tsv dropped as default in DIA-NN 2.0
report = report[(report['Q.Value'] <= 0.01) & (report['PG.Q.Value'] <= 0.01)]  # 1% FDR before quant

matrix = report.pivot_table(index='Protein.Group', columns='Run', values='PG.MaxLFQ', aggfunc='first')
```

## Diagnosing the Missingness Contract

**Goal:** Quantify the missing-value pattern so the legitimate imputation class can be chosen downstream.

**Approach:** Count NaN per protein and per sample; relate the pattern to acquisition mode (DDA -> structured MNAR; DIA -> closer to MCAR). A correlation between missingness and mean abundance is the MNAR signature.

```python
import numpy as np

def assess_missingness(matrix, sample_cols):
    miss_per_protein = matrix[sample_cols].isna().sum(axis=1)
    miss_per_sample = matrix[sample_cols].isna().sum(axis=0)
    total_pct = 100 * matrix[sample_cols].isna().sum().sum() / matrix[sample_cols].size
    mean_abund = matrix[sample_cols].mean(axis=1)  # negative corr with missingness => MNAR / left-censored
    mnar_corr = mean_abund.corr(miss_per_protein)
    return {'per_protein': miss_per_protein, 'per_sample': miss_per_sample, 'total_pct': total_pct, 'abundance_missing_corr': mnar_corr}
```

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### MaxQuant wrong quant column

**Trigger:** Reading `Intensity` (raw) or `iBAQ` when between-sample ratios are intended.
**Mechanism:** `Intensity` is un-normalized summed precursor signal; `iBAQ` is a within-sample molar proxy. Neither is comparable across samples the way `LFQ intensity` is.
**Symptom:** Ratios track total loaded protein / sample depth rather than biology; fold changes shift when one sample's loading changes.
**Fix:** Use `LFQ intensity` for cross-sample comparison; if computing custom normalization use `Intensity` and normalize explicitly (expression-matrix/normalization).

### Zero treated as a measurement

**Trigger:** `np.log2` applied directly to a MaxQuant matrix still containing 0.
**Mechanism:** MaxQuant encodes "not quantified" as 0; log2(0) = -inf, which then propagates into means and tests.
**Symptom:** -inf values, NaN means, proteins silently dropped or skewed.
**Fix:** `replace(0, np.nan)` before any transform; then diagnose missingness.

### Bookkeeping rows survive

**Trigger:** Loading proteinGroups.txt without filtering Reverse / Potential contaminant / Only identified by site.
**Mechanism:** Decoys exist only for FDR estimation; contaminants are keratin/trypsin/BSA, not the sample; site-only groups have no unmodified-peptide quant evidence. `Only identified by site` exists only in proteinGroups.txt.
**Symptom:** Inflated protein counts; a "hit" that is a decoy or keratin.
**Fix:** Filter all three flag columns; cross-check with `REV__`/`CON__` ID prefixes when joining to peptide tables. Caveat: do not delete CON__ rows blindly if a contaminant (e.g. keratin) is the protein of interest.

### Razor / leading protein-ID ambiguity ignored

**Trigger:** Treating `Protein IDs` or `Gene names` as an atomic single value.
**Mechanism:** These are semicolon-delimited lists; the first entry is the leading (razor) protein for the group, and `Gene names` can be blank while protein IDs are present.
**Symptom:** Merges fail, NaN gene labels, ambiguous identity downstream.
**Fix:** Split on `;` and take the first entry; guard `Gene names` with `.notna()`. Group parsimony details -> protein-inference.

### Stale DIA-NN parsing

**Trigger:** Reading `report.tsv` on DIA-NN 2.0, or pivoting before q-filtering.
**Mechanism:** 2.0 defaults to (and only defaults to) `report.parquet`; pivoting unfiltered rows includes precursors above 1% FDR.
**Symptom:** FileNotFoundError on report.tsv; or low-confidence quant inflating the matrix.
**Fix:** `pd.read_parquet('report.parquet')`; filter `Q.Value <= 0.01 & PG.Q.Value <= 0.01` before pivoting `PG.MaxLFQ`.

### MNAR imputed as MCAR

**Trigger:** Mean/median/KNN imputation on a DDA matrix.
**Mechanism:** DDA missingness is abundance-dependent (left-censored); MCAR imputers fill missing low values with the central tendency, biasing them upward.
**Symptom:** Low-abundance proteins gain false high values; spurious differential hits.
**Fix:** Diagnose the abundance-missingness correlation here; route DDA to left-censored imputation (downshifted-Gaussian / QRILC / MinProb) in differential-abundance; DIA tolerates standard imputers.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| DIA-NN import filter `Q.Value <= 0.01` AND `PG.Q.Value <= 0.01` | Demichev 2020; target-decoy convention | Precursor- and protein-group-level 1% FDR enforced before any quant value is used |
| Peptide/protein FDR 1% (q <= 0.01) | Target-decoy convention | Standard ID confidence at both peptide and protein levels |
| MaxQuant zero -> NaN | MaxQuant output convention | 0 encodes "not quantified"; log2(0) = -inf corrupts every transform |
| Min peptides per protein for quant >= 2 | Community quant practice | Single-peptide ("one-hit-wonder") proteins are ID/quant-unreliable |
| Valid-value filter >= 50-70% per group | Modeling choice (document per study) | Caps imputation burden; the exact cutoff is a study decision, not a universal constant |
| Take FIRST semicolon entry as leading protein/gene | MaxQuant proteinGroups convention | The leading/razor protein is the group identifier; trailing entries are shared-peptide members |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| `-inf` values after log2 | Zeros not converted to NaN | `df.replace(0, np.nan)` before `np.log2` |
| `FileNotFoundError: report.tsv` (DIA-NN 2.0) | TSV no longer the default output | `pd.read_parquet('report.parquet')` |
| `KeyError: 'Only identified by site'` | That column exists ONLY in proteinGroups.txt | Use `df.get('Only identified by site', '')` or guard the column lookup |
| Mixed-type / DtypeWarning on MaxQuant load | Wide TSV with mixed column types | `pd.read_csv(..., low_memory=False)` |
| NaN gene labels break a merge | `Gene names` is a semicolon list, sometimes blank | `.where(notna(), '').str.split(';').str[0]` |
| Ratios track loading not biology | Read `Intensity` (raw) instead of `LFQ intensity` | Use `LFQ intensity` for between-sample comparison |
| `get_peaks()` unpacking error | Expecting a 2D array | It returns a tuple `(mz, intensity)` of two numpy arrays |
