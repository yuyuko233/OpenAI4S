## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: BioPython 1.83+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Sequence Properties

Calculate physical and chemical properties of nucleotide and protein sequences using Biopython.

**"Calculate GC content"** -> Compute the fraction of G+C bases in a nucleotide sequence.
- Python: `gc_fraction(seq)` (Bio.SeqUtils) - returns a FRACTION 0-1, multiply by 100 for percent.

**"Compute a primer melting temperature"** -> Estimate Tm for hybridization or PCR.
- Python: `MeltingTemp.Tm_NN(seq)` (Bio.SeqUtils) - nearest-neighbor, the accurate method for primers.

**"Analyze protein properties"** -> Compute MW, pI, stability, hydrophobicity from an amino-acid sequence.
- Python: `ProteinAnalysis(str_seq)` (Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam).

## The governing principle

Most of these functions return a plausible number for any input, so the danger is silent wrongness, not crashes. Three defaults bite hardest: `gc_fraction` returns a FRACTION (not the percent the legacy `GC()` returned), `molecular_weight` defaults to a SINGLE strand (~half a duplex), and `Tm_Wallace`/`Tm_GC` are composition-only methods that are wrong for real primers. Pick the function to match the question and verify its units, not just that it ran.

## Required Imports

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import gc_fraction, molecular_weight, GC123, GC_skew, MeltingTemp, nt_search, seq1, seq3
from Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam import ProteinAnalysis
```

## DNA/RNA Properties

### GC Content

`gc_fraction()` returns a fraction in [0, 1]. The legacy `GC()` returned a percent in [0, 100] and was REMOVED in BioPython 1.82 (`from Bio.SeqUtils import GC` now raises ImportError).

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import gc_fraction

seq = Seq('ATGCGATCGATCGATCGATCG')
gc = gc_fraction(seq)        # 0.476... (FRACTION, not percent)
gc_percent = gc * 100        # 47.6 - multiply for percent
```

Factor-of-100 trap: porting `GC(seq)` to `gc_fraction(seq)` without `* 100` silently underreports 100x, so downstream filters like "GC > 40" reject everything.

Ambiguity-default trap: the new default `ambiguous='remove'` strips ambiguity codes before computing, but legacy `GC()` counted them in the length only, which equals the new `ambiguous='ignore'`. The faithful drop-in replacement is `gc_fraction(seq, ambiguous='ignore') * 100`. The modes only diverge on sequences that actually contain ambiguity codes (so clean test fixtures hide the difference, real data exposes it).

```python
gc_fraction(seq, ambiguous='remove')    # default: ambiguity codes stripped (neither numerator nor denominator)
gc_fraction(seq, ambiguous='ignore')    # counts ambiguous in denominator only - matches legacy GC()
gc_fraction(seq, ambiguous='weighted')  # each code contributes its mean GC probability (N/X = 0.5)
```

### GC at Codon Positions (GC123)

`GC123()` returns FOUR PERCENTAGES (0-100) - total GC plus GC at codon positions 1, 2, 3 (position 3 is the wobble base, most free to vary under codon bias). Note the unit inconsistency with `gc_fraction`: these are percentages, not fractions. `GC123` does not handle ambiguity codes.

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC123

gc_total, gc_pos1, gc_pos2, gc_pos3 = GC123(Seq('ATGCGATCGATCGATCGATCG'))  # all 0-100
```

### GC Skew

`GC_skew(seq, window=100)` returns `(G-C)/(G+C)` for each non-overlapping window. A window with no G or C returns 0 (the zero-division is guarded), which can be misread as "no skew" rather than "no data".

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC_skew

skew_values = GC_skew(seq, window=1000)  # list of per-window skew values
```

Biology: cumulative GC skew has a global MINIMUM at the replication origin (oriC) and a MAXIMUM at the terminus on circular bacterial chromosomes - the leading strand is G-enriched from strand-asymmetric mutation/repair. This is the basis of in-silico origin prediction. Compute the cumulative skew by taking the running sum of `GC_skew()`.

`xGC_skew()` is a GRAPHICS routine (its docstring literally says "GRAPHICS !!!") that draws on a Tkinter canvas. It raises a loud TclError/ImportError in headless environments. For headless cumulative-skew analysis, sum `GC_skew()` yourself instead.

### Molecular Weight

`molecular_weight(seq, seq_type='DNA', double_stranded=False, circular=False, monoisotopic=False)`.

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import molecular_weight

dna = Seq('ATGCGATCG')
mw_ss = molecular_weight(dna)                          # single-stranded (DEFAULT)
mw_ds = molecular_weight(dna, double_stranded=True)    # full duplex mass
mw_circ = molecular_weight(dna, circular=True)         # no terminal phosphate adjustment
mw_rna = molecular_weight(Seq('AUGCGAUCG'), seq_type='RNA')
mw_prot = molecular_weight(Seq('MRCRS'), seq_type='protein')
mw_mono = molecular_weight(dna, monoisotopic=True)     # most-abundant isotope, for high-res MS
```

Double-stranded trap (~2x, silent): the default `double_stranded=False` returns a single-strand mass - roughly half a duplex. For genomic dsDNA pass `double_stranded=True`. It is NOT exactly half, because the complementary strand has a different base composition, so a non-self-complementary single-strand number cannot be "fixed later" by doubling. ng-to-molecule, copy-number, and molarity conversions all come out ~2x wrong.

Monoisotopic vs average: the default is average mass (bulk, spectrophotometric). Pass `monoisotopic=True` to match high-resolution mass spec (ESI/MALDI); the wrong choice is a silent systematic offset that grows with mass. Ambiguous letters raise ValueError (loud - good).

### Melting Temperature

**Goal:** Estimate the Tm of an oligo, choosing a method that matches its length and use.

**Approach:** Use `Tm_NN` for any PCR primer (nearest-neighbor, sequence-order aware). Reserve `Tm_Wallace` for very short probes and `Tm_GC` only when a composition-only estimate is acceptable.

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import MeltingTemp as mt

primer = Seq('ACGGTCAGGTCAGGTACGGT')

tm = mt.Tm_NN(primer, strict=True)                       # accurate primer Tm
tm_salt = mt.Tm_NN(primer, Na=50, dnac1=250, dnac2=250)  # 50 mM Na+, 250 nM each strand
tm_mg = mt.Tm_NN(primer, Mg=1.5, dNTPs=0.2, saltcorr=7)  # Mg/dNTPs ONLY honored at saltcorr 6 or 7
```

| Method | Model | Use when | Caveat |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| `Tm_Wallace` | 4(G+C) + 2(A+T) "2+4 rule" | Oligos <=14 nt only | Ignores order/salt; WRONG for primers (off 5-10 C+) |
| `Tm_GC` | GC-content empirical equation | Longer sequences, rough estimate | Composition-only, no nearest-neighbor info |
| `Tm_NN` | Nearest-neighbor thermodynamics | PCR primers, probes, accurate work | Needs realistic salt/strand conc for absolute values |

`Tm_NN` defaults: `nn_table=None` which selects `DNA_NN3` (Allawi & SantaLucia 1997), `saltcorr=5`, strand concentrations `dnac1=dnac2=25` nM. `saltcorr` ranges 1-7, but only 6 (Owczarzy 2004) and 7 (Owczarzy 2008) actually use Mg2+/dNTPs - setting `Mg`/`dNTPs` with `saltcorr<=5` silently ignores them. Keep `strict=True` for primer work: it raises on ambiguous or unsupported nearest-neighbor pairs, whereas `strict=False` silently skips them and underestimates Tm.

### IUPAC-Aware Search (nt_search)

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import nt_search

result = nt_search('ATGCGATCGATCGATNGATC', 'GATNGATC')  # ['GAT[GATC]GATC', 4] - result[0] is the EXPANDED regex, result[1:] are 0-based starts
```

## Protein Properties

**Goal:** Compute biophysical properties of a protein from its amino-acid sequence.

**Approach:** Create one `ProteinAnalysis` object and call its methods. Non-standard residues (B, Z, X, U, `*`, `-`) are absent from the parameter tables and raise KeyError, so sanitize first.

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam import ProteinAnalysis

clean = 'MAEGEITTFTALTEKFNLPPGNYKKPKLLYCSNG'.replace('*', '').replace('X', '')
protein = ProteinAnalysis(clean)

mw = protein.molecular_weight()              # protein average MW (Daltons)
pi = protein.isoelectric_point()             # pI from linear-sequence pKa tables
charge = protein.charge_at_pH(7.0)           # net charge at a given pH
ii = protein.instability_index()             # Guruprasad: > 40 => predicted unstable
gravy = protein.gravy()                       # mean Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy (neg = hydrophilic)
arom = protein.aromaticity()                 # relative frequency of F + W + Y
helix, turn, sheet = protein.secondary_structure_fraction()
eps_reduced, eps_oxidized = protein.molar_extinction_coefficient()  # 280 nm, (reduced, cystine)
flex = protein.flexibility()                 # per-residue, fixed window of 9
```

Interpretation caveats:
- `isoelectric_point()` and `charge_at_pH()` use fixed pKa tables on the LINEAR sequence - they ignore 3D environment and post-translational modifications, so a measured pI can differ by a full pH unit or more.
- `gravy(scale='KyteDoolitle')` - the default scale literal is MISSPELLED `'KyteDoolitle'` (one 't'). Passing the correctly-spelled `'KyteDoolittle'` raises KeyError. A single whole-protein average also collapses local topology (a TM helix plus hydrophilic loops can average near 0); use a windowed hydropathy profile for membrane topology.
- `secondary_structure_fraction()` is a composition propensity estimate, not a structure prediction.
- `instability_index()` uses Guruprasad's dipeptide method; > 40 predicts an unstable protein.

### Amino-Acid Code Conversion

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import seq1, seq3

seq1('MetAlaGlyTrp')           # 'MAGW'  (3-letter -> 1-letter)
seq3('MAGW')                   # 'MetAlaGlyTrp'  (1-letter -> 3-letter, no separator)
```

## Code Patterns

### Per-Record GC Across a FASTA

**Goal:** Report length and GC percent for every record in a file.

**Approach:** Stream records with `SeqIO.parse`, compute GC per record, multiply the fraction by 100.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.SeqUtils import gc_fraction

def analyze_fasta(filename):
    return [{'id': r.id, 'length': len(r.seq), 'gc': gc_fraction(r.seq) * 100} for r in SeqIO.parse(filename, 'fasta')]
```

### Cumulative GC Skew (Headless)

**Goal:** Locate a candidate replication origin without the Tkinter graphics routine.

**Approach:** Take per-window skew from `GC_skew`, accumulate it, and read off the minimum (oriC) and maximum (terminus).

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC_skew

def cumulative_skew(seq, window=10000):
    skew = GC_skew(seq, window=window)
    positions, cumulative, total = [], [], 0
    for i, s in enumerate(skew):
        total += s
        positions.append(i * window)
        cumulative.append(total)
    ori = positions[cumulative.index(min(cumulative))]
    return positions, cumulative, ori
```

### Full Protein Report

**Goal:** Summarize the key biophysical metrics of a protein in one pass.

**Approach:** Sanitize non-standard residues, build one `ProteinAnalysis` object, and collect each metric into a dict.

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam import ProteinAnalysis

def protein_report(sequence):
    clean = str(sequence).upper().replace('*', '').replace('X', '')
    protein = ProteinAnalysis(clean)
    helix, turn, sheet = protein.secondary_structure_fraction()
    return {
        'length': len(clean),
        'molecular_weight': protein.molecular_weight(),
        'isoelectric_point': protein.isoelectric_point(),
        'charge_at_pH7': protein.charge_at_pH(7.0),
        'instability_index': protein.instability_index(),
        'gravy': protein.gravy(),
        'aromaticity': protein.aromaticity(),
        'helix_fraction': helix, 'turn_fraction': turn, 'sheet_fraction': sheet,
    }
```

### CpG Observed/Expected Ratio

```python
def cpg_ratio(seq):
    s = str(seq).upper()
    expected = (s.count('C') * s.count('G')) / len(s) if s else 0
    return s.count('CG') / expected if expected > 0 else 0
```

## Property Reference

| Property | Function | Units / Notes |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| GC content | `gc_fraction()` | FRACTION 0-1 (multiply by 100 for percent) |
| GC by codon position | `GC123()` | FOUR PERCENTAGES 0-100 (total + pos 1/2/3) |
| GC skew | `GC_skew()` | (G-C)/(G+C) per window; 0 = no G/C in window |
| Molecular weight | `molecular_weight()` | Daltons; single-strand by DEFAULT |
| Melting temp | `MeltingTemp.Tm_NN()` | Celsius; accurate for primers |
| pI / charge | `isoelectric_point()` / `charge_at_pH()` | Linear pKa only, ignores 3D/PTMs |
| Instability | `instability_index()` | > 40 => predicted unstable |
| Hydropathy | `gravy()` | neg = hydrophilic; default scale misspelled `'KyteDoolitle'` |

## Common Errors

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| GC values look 100x too small; filters reject all | Used `gc_fraction()` (fraction) where percent expected | Multiply by 100 |
| GC differs from legacy `GC()` on real data | Default `ambiguous='remove'` vs legacy `'ignore'` | Use `gc_fraction(seq, ambiguous='ignore') * 100` for a faithful drop-in |
| `GC_skew` returns 0 across a region | Window had no G or C (guarded division), not true zero skew | Treat 0 as "no data"; widen the window |
| `xGC_skew` raises TclError/ImportError | It is a Tkinter graphics routine, fails headless | Sum `GC_skew()` yourself for cumulative skew |
| Primer Tm off by 5-10 C | Used `Tm_Wallace`/`Tm_GC` (composition-only) | Use `Tm_NN` with realistic salt and strand concentration |
| Mg/dNTPs change nothing in `Tm_NN` | `Mg`/`dNTPs` ignored unless `saltcorr` is 6 or 7 | Set `saltcorr=7` (Owczarzy 2008) for divalent correction |
| MW ~half of expected for genomic dsDNA | `molecular_weight` default `double_stranded=False` | Pass `double_stranded=True` |
| `KeyError` from `ProteinAnalysis` | Non-standard residue (B, Z, X, U, `*`, `-`) | Strip or replace before analysis |
| `KeyError` from `gravy('KyteDoolittle')` | Default scale literal is misspelled `'KyteDoolitle'` (one 't') | Omit the argument or pass `'KyteDoolitle'` |
