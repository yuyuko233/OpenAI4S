description: Detect positive (diversifying / episodic / pervasive) selection using codon dN/dS frameworks. Implements PAML codeml site models (M0/M1a/M2a/M7/M8/M8a), branch models, branch-site model A (Zhang 2005), and HyPhy methods (BUSTED, BUSTED-S, BUSTED-MH, BUSTED-PH, MEME, FEL, FUBAR, aBSREL, SLAC, RELAX, GARD, FUBAR-MH). Includes McDonald-Kreitman framework (asymptotic alpha, impMKT, polyDFE, DFE-alpha, GRAPES) for within-species + divergence inference, RERconverge for trait-correlated rate shifts, CSUBST for convergent substitution, and PhyloAcc for accelerated noncoding evolution. Use when testing adaptive evolution at codons, branches, or full gene; running GARD recombination pre-screen; controlling alignment-error and gBGC false positives; reconciling PAML vs HyPhy results; or performing genome-scale selection scans.

## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: PAML 4.10.7+, HyPhy 2.5.62+ (BUSTED-MH from Lucaci 2023 MBE 40:msad150; FUBAR-MH from same), datamonkey.org 2024+ for web jobs, IQ-TREE 2.3.6+, MACSE V2.07+, PRANK 170427+, MAFFT 7.526+, PREQUAL 1.02+, HmmCleaner 0.243+, GARD (HyPhy bundled), RDP5 5.59+, ete4 4.1.0+, BioPython 1.84+, scipy 1.13+, polyDFE 2.0+, DFE-alpha 2.16+, GRAPES 1.1.1+, RERconverge 0.3.0+, CSUBST 1.6.0+, PhyloAcc 2.4.0+. Quest-for-Selection benchmark refreshed annually.

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- CLI: `codeml` (PAML; check by `codeml /dev/null` -- prints version banner), `hyphy --version`, `gard --help`
- Python: `pip show pyhyphy`; introspect ete4 API for tree-labeling
- R: `packageVersion('RERconverge')`; `?correlateWithBinaryPhenotype`

If code throws `branch-site test LRT non-positive`, `omega2 hit upper bound 999`, `MEME ML mixed gradient`, the most common cause is alignment error or saturated dS -- inspect alignment with TCS / Guidance2 and dS-vs-divergence-time. PAML 4.10 changed several control-file keywords from 4.9 (`getSE = 1` syntax tightened).

# Positive Selection Analysis

**"Is this gene / branch / site under positive selection?"** -> dN/dS (omega = nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ratio) framework with explicit choice of WHICH question is being asked (gene-wide / branch-specific / site-specific / episodic) and WHICH null is being rejected. The "test failed because of selection" claim has more known confounders than any other comparative-genomics inference; **mandatory pre-screens are: recombination (GARD), alignment errors (PREQUAL or HmmCleaner), saturation (dS distribution), and gBGC (W->S substitution bias)**. Skipping any one inflates Type-I error to ~20-50% (Anisimova & Yang 2007 MBE 24:1219; Pond 2006 Mol Biol Evol 23:1891).

The BUSTED-MH and FUBAR-MH (multi-hit) extensions specifically address known Type-I inflation from multi-nucleotide substitutions and are now recommended over basic BUSTED / FUBAR.

## Decision Tree by Experimental Scenario

| Scenario | Recommended approach | Why |
|----------|------------------------|-----|
| Single gene, mammalian (~60 Myr), pre-specified foreground branch | codeml branch-site mod A AND HyPhy aBSREL on foreground | Mutual validation; mod A LRT df=1 + aBSREL adaptive site classes |
| Single gene, deep eukaryote (~500+ Myr), no foreground hypothesis | GARD pre-screen -> BUSTED-MH gene-wide -> MEME for sites | Episodic-selection-only methods; saturation-aware (HyPhy under MG94 codon model) |
| Genome-wide scan, vertebrates | codeml M7 vs M8 OR HyPhy FUBAR-MH per gene; FDR-correct | Pervasive-selection sites; multi-hit correction critical at scale |
| Episodic selection scan | HyPhy MEME genome-wide (per gene); FDR-correct | Site-level episodic detection |
| Branch-specific selection on unspecified branches | HyPhy aBSREL | Adaptive per-branch test with built-in multiple-testing |
| Comparing selection regimes between two phenotypes | HyPhy BUSTED-PH or RELAX | Phenotype-specific or relaxation-detection |
| Recently diverged species (low divergence) | MK / asymptotic alpha (population genetics) | Codon dN/dS unreliable at low divergence; SFS-based instead |
| Within-species, dense polymorphism + divergence | polyDFE / GRAPES / asymptotic-MK | Full DFE + alpha jointly; preferred for adaptive-substitution rate |
| Coding selection genome-wide, with SFS available | grapes -m AUTO_ALL | Demography-aware alpha; standard population-genetics-aware adaptive-substitution scan |
| Noncoding accelerated evolution (CNEs / ECRs) | PhyloAcc, phyloP-acc | Codon-based unsuitable; PhyloAcc Bayesian convergence |
| Convergent substitutions across independent lineages | CSUBST | Combinatorial-substitution omegaC; null-corrected |
| Trait-correlated rate shifts genome-wide | RERconverge | Categorical / binary phenotype; correlates RERs across thousands of genes |
| Suspected positive selection but dS > 2 | Use protein-level method or reduce taxon sampling | Codon-based methods unreliable at saturation; protein-only ASR can still work |
| Recombination expected (immune genes, viral genomes) | GARD pre-screen mandatory | Recombination + tree-based selection -> false positives (Anisimova 2003) |
| Convergent codon substitution at specific sites | TDG09 (Tamuri 2009) or PCOC (Rey 2018) | TDG09 detects site-specific shifts in selective constraint between trait-defined lineage groups; PCOC detects convergent amino-acid substitution |
| Drug-target evolution screen | aBSREL on candidate genes; cross-validate with MEME | Recent positive selection at drug-target loci |
| Pathogen / immune-evasion gene with high dS variation | BUSTED-S (synonymous rate variation aware) | dS variation across sites violates basic BUSTED assumptions |
| Plasmodium / Trypanosoma / Plasmid analysis | BUSTED-MH (multi-hit aware) | Multi-nucleotide substitutions common in these; basic BUSTED inflates false positives |

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### Recombination producing false positive selection

**Trigger:** Running codeml or BUSTED on a gene with recombination breakpoints (viral genes, immune genes, paralog families).

**Mechanism:** All single-tree codon models assume one phylogeny across all sites. Recombination produces different trees for different segments; treating them as one tree forces the model to invent rate variation that mimics positive selection (Anisimova et al 2003 Genetics 164:1229).

**Symptom:** PAML M8 strongly rejects M7 (LRT > 50), with omega2 = 999 (PAML upper bound) at several "selected sites"; HyPhy BUSTED highly significant; sites clustered in specific gene regions.

**Fix:** **MANDATORY: run GARD before any positive selection test.** If GARD detects breakpoints (p < 0.05), partition the alignment at breakpoints and analyze each segment separately, or use the recombination-aware MEME with the partitioned tree set. RDP5 (Martin 2021 Virus Evol 7:veaa087) is an alternative for viral genomes. GARD output `.json` lists breakpoint positions and posterior support.

### Alignment errors producing false positives

**Trigger:** Using default MAFFT or MUSCLE alignment on divergent CDS sequences; skipping codon-aware aligner.

**Mechanism:** Frame-shifted or misaligned codons introduce apparent non-synonymous substitutions at every position; codon-aware tools see these as positive selection (Schneider 2009 GBE 1:114; Markova-Raina & Petrov 2011 GR 21:863).

**Symptom:** "Selected sites" cluster in alignment regions with > 30% gaps; per-site posteriors in BEB / FUBAR concentrate in ambiguous columns; PREQUAL or Guidance2 marks these regions as poorly aligned; protein alignment shows obvious mismatches.

**Fix:** Use codon-aware aligner: **PRANK** (Loytynoja 2014 Methods Mol Biol 1079:155) is the standard for selection analysis (correctly models insertions); MACSE V2 (Ranwez 2018 MBE 35:2582) handles frameshifts and pseudogenes natively; OMM_MACSE wrapper combines them. After alignment, filter with PREQUAL (segment-level) or HmmCleaner (Di Franco 2019 BMC Evol Biol 19:21); do NOT use block-filtering (Gblocks, trimAl) which removes informative sites. Segment-level filtering preferred for selection (Di Franco 2019).

### Saturated synonymous sites

**Trigger:** Comparing distantly related taxa (deep eukaryotic divergence, > 100 Myr); dS > 3 across most pairs.

**Mechanism:** Synonymous sites have undergone multiple substitutions; the observed dS underestimates true dS. The model can't recover the true rate; omega = dN/dS becomes unstable at the upper bound or low (depending on which direction the bias goes).

**Symptom:** PAML M0 omega = 999 or near-zero; per-branch dS variance huge; sites with omega > 1 in M8 BEB are at conserved residues (paradox).

**Fix:** Reduce taxon sampling to species with dS < 2 on internal branches. For deep selection inference on conserved residues, use protein-level methods (BUSTED with `--model GTR` AA codon translation; aBSREL with protein model option) or restrict to subclade with reasonable saturation. Yang 2007 PAML manual recommends dS < 1.5 per branch.

### gBGC inflating apparent positive selection

**Trigger:** Mammalian / vertebrate gene with W->S substitution bias on a fast-evolving lineage.

**Mechanism:** GC-biased gene conversion fixes A/T -> G/C alleles preferentially in regions of high recombination, independent of selection (Galtier & Duret 2007 Trends Genet 23:273; Capra 2013 PLoS Genet 9:e1003684). Standard codon models attribute this to positive selection because nonsynonymous substitutions are unequally distributed across codon positions.

**Symptom:** Branch with apparent positive selection sits in high-recombination region; W->S / S->W substitution ratio > 1.5; selected sites concentrate at non-degenerate codon positions; HyPhy MEME-MH and BUSTED-MH attribute signal to multi-hit rather than positive selection.

**Fix:** Test for gBGC: W->S substitution rates on selected branch / S->W rates; report ratio. Re-run selection analysis with HyPhy BUSTED-MH (multi-hit aware); if signal vanishes, the original "selection" was gBGC + multi-hit substitutions. For genome-wide scans, mask sub-telomeric / high-recombination regions.

### Branch-site test foreground specification

**Trigger:** Running codeml branch-site mod A after looking at the data to choose foreground branch.

**Mechanism:** The branch-site test is designed for a single a priori foreground; post hoc specification inflates Type-I by ~5x because the choice was informed by the data.

**Symptom:** Branch-site test highly significant for the "interesting" branch; aBSREL on same data shows no significant branch (aBSREL has built-in multiple-testing correction).

**Fix:** Specify foreground branches in registered protocol before looking at data. For exploratory branch-wise analysis, use aBSREL (Smith 2015 MBE 32:1342) which adaptively assigns branch-specific omega classes with multiple-testing built in. If branch-site test was post hoc, apply Bonferroni correction across all branches tested + report explicitly.

### LRT critical value confusion

**Trigger:** Computing branch-site test p-value using standard chi-square df=2.

**Mechanism:** The branch-site test compares mod A (4 omega classes) against mod A1 (omega2 fixed at 1). The LRT statistic distribution is a 50:50 mixture of point-mass-at-0 and chi-square(df=1), not chi-square(df=2) (Self & Liang 1987 JASA 82:605; Zhang 2005 MBE 22:2472; Wong 2004 Genetics 168:1041). Using df=2 makes the test conservative; using df=1 standard makes it anticonservative.

**Symptom:** Branch-site p-values incorrectly inflated or deflated; users report finding selection at very stringent thresholds.

**Fix:** Use the 50:50 mixture critical value: 2.71 at p=0.05 (NOT 3.84). PAML's `chi2 1 LRT` command applies the mixture. Many published applications use chi-square df=2 conservatively, which loses power but doesn't inflate; chi-square df=1 directly is wrong and inflates Type-I.

### omega2 hitting upper bound (999)

**Trigger:** PAML codeml output shows omega2 = 999 for an "under selection" site class.

**Mechanism:** PAML codeml uses an internal upper bound of 999 (= "infinity" in single precision). Hitting it indicates numerical issue: extremely few synonymous sites in the selected class, dS underestimation, or numerical optimization failure.

**Symptom:** Sites flagged as positive selection have omega2 = 999; BEB posteriors for those sites are weirdly distributed.

**Fix:** Re-run with multiple starting values of omega (`fix_omega=0`, vary `omega = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0` across runs); check that all converge to same omega. Inspect alignment at flagged sites for unusual residue conservation. If omega = 999 persists, the gene may have rare-substitution patterns; switch to BUSTED-MH which accounts for multi-hit substitutions.

### Multiple-testing burden in genome scans

**Trigger:** Running selection tests across thousands of genes without correction.

**Mechanism:** With ~5000 protein-coding genes in a typical analysis, 250 will be significant at p=0.05 under H0. The false-discovery rate without correction is 50%.

**Symptom:** Implausibly large gene lists "under selection"; functional categories enriched are non-specific (e.g. all immune genes by FDR).

**Fix:** Apply FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg). Genes in syntenic regions are non-independent; use Benjamini-Yekutieli for stronger control under dependence. For HyPhy site-level methods, the per-site p < 0.1 default is a starting point; multiple-test correction within a gene is typically not applied (sites within a gene are dependent), but cross-gene correction is necessary. Holm-Bonferroni for strict Type-I.

### Convergent substitution misinterpreted as positive selection

**Trigger:** Lineage-specific selection found at a residue that has independently changed in multiple unrelated lineages.

**Mechanism:** Convergent substitutions at the same site in independent lineages produce signals in branch-site and other tests; this is convergence, not adaptive evolution per se (though convergent residues often ARE adaptive).

**Symptom:** Same residue flagged in multiple unrelated lineages by branch-site test; alignment shows convergent substitutions.

**Fix:** Switch from selection test to convergence test: CSUBST (Fukushima & Pollock 2023 Nat Eco Evo 7:155) for combinatorial substitution analysis; RERconverge (Redlich 2024 MBE 41:msae210) for relative-rate-vs-phenotype across categorical traits; PCOC (Rey 2018) for biophysical convergence. Report both convergence test and selection test results.

## Selection Scan Standard Pipeline

**Goal:** Test all coding genes in a clade for evidence of positive selection, with full quality control.

**Approach:** Align with PRANK -> filter with PREQUAL -> pre-screen with GARD -> run BUSTED-MH (gene-wide) + MEME (sites) + aBSREL (branches); FDR-correct across genes; verify top candidates pass alignment / saturation / gBGC checks.

```bash
# Per-gene pipeline (parallelizable)
for og in orthogroups/*.fa; do
    base=$(basename $og .fa)

    # 1. Codon-aware MSA
    prank -d=$og -o=msa/$base.prank -codon -F

    # 2. Filter alignment errors (segment-level)
    PREQUAL -i msa/$base.prank.best.fas -o msa_filt/$base

    # 3. Recombination pre-screen
    hyphy gard --alignment msa_filt/$base.filtered --output gard/$base.json
    # If breakpoints found: partition and treat per-segment

    # 4. Gene-wide test (multi-hit aware)
    hyphy busted --alignment msa_filt/$base.filtered \
        --tree species_tree.nwk --output busted_mh/$base.json \
        --srv Yes --multiple-hits Double+Triple

    # 5. Site-level
    hyphy meme --alignment msa_filt/$base.filtered \
        --tree species_tree.nwk --output meme/$base.json

    # 6. Branch-level
    hyphy absrel --alignment msa_filt/$base.filtered \
        --tree species_tree.nwk --output absrel/$base.json
done

# 7. Aggregate and FDR

## PAML Branch-Site Test (Operational)

**Goal:** Test for episodic positive selection on a pre-specified foreground branch.

**Approach:** Mark foreground in newick (`#1`) -> codeml branch-site mod A vs A1 -> LRT against 50:50 mixture chi^2(0):chi^2(1).

```bash
# Mark foreground branch: use ete4 or manually
python3 -c "
from ete4 import Tree
t = Tree('species_tree.nwk', format=1)
target = t.search_nodes(name='target_species')[0]
target.name = target.name + ' #1'
print(t.write(format=1))

    p = 0.5 * (1 - chi2.cdf(lrt, df=1))
    return {'LRT': lrt, 'p_value': p}
```

Foreground branch must be specified before viewing data; for genome-wide screens with no a priori branch, use aBSREL instead. Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) sites with posterior > 0.95 on positive-selection class are the per-site call.

## McDonald-Kreitman with Asymptotic Alpha

**Goal:** Estimate adaptive substitution rate alpha = 1 - (Ds Pn) / (Dn Ps), corrected for slightly deleterious bias.

**Approach:** Compute counts of synonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphisms (P) and divergences (D); fit asymptotic alpha by binning by minor-allele frequency and extrapolating.

```r
# Standard MK
mk_alpha <- function(Dn, Ds, Pn, Ps) {
    1 - (Ds * Pn) / (Dn * Ps)
}

# Asymptotic alpha via the Messer-Petrov 2013 web tool
# (https://benhaller.com/messerlab/asymptoticMK.html) or the impMKT R package
# (Murga-Moreno 2022 G3 12:jkac206) which wraps the asymptotic computation.
library(impMKT)
# Inputs: per-frequency-bin (Pn, Ps) plus genome-wide (Dn, Ds)
freq_bins <- seq(0.01, 0.5, 0.01)
pn_by_freq <- c(...)  # nonsyn polymorphism count per bin
ps_by_freq <- c(...)  # syn polymorphism count per bin
fit <- asymptoticMK(
    Dn = total_dn, Ds = total_ds,
    Pn = pn_by_freq, Ps = ps_by_freq,
    x = freq_bins
)
fit$alpha_asymptotic       # adaptive substitution rate, corrected
fit$alpha_original         # original MK (biased)
```

For full DFE inference (alpha + distribution of fitness effects), use polyDFE (Tataru-Bataillon 2019):

```bash
polyDFE -d data.txt -m C -i estimates.init -o output_basename
```

DFE-alpha (Eyre-Walker 2009) and GRAPES (Galtier 2016) are alternatives; GRAPES is most robust for genome-wide adaptive-substitution scans.

## RERconverge for Trait-Correlated Rate Shifts

**Goal:** Identify genes whose evolutionary rate correlates with a binary or categorical phenotype across the species tree.

**Approach:** Compute per-gene relative evolutionary rates -> correlate against phenotype -> Bonferroni or FDR-correct across genes.

```r
library(RERconverge)

# Read alignments and tree
trees <- readTrees('orthogroup_trees.txt', minSpecies = 10)
rer <- getAllResiduals(trees, useSpecies = species_names, transform = 'sqrt',
                       weighted = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

# Define binary phenotype (e.g., echolocation in mammals)
phen_paths <- foreground2Paths(c('Bat1', 'Bat2', 'Dolphin'), trees, clade = 'terminal')
phen_vec <- foreground2Tree(c('Bat1', 'Bat2', 'Dolphin'), trees, clade = 'terminal')

# Correlate
cors <- correlateWithBinaryPhenotype(rer, phen_paths, min.sp = 10, min.pos = 2,
                                      weighted = 'auto')
top_genes <- cors[order(cors$P), ][1:50, ]
```

For categorical traits (more than binary), Redlich 2024 MBE 41:msae210 extends RERconverge.

## Reconciliation: When Methods Disagree

| Pattern | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| codeml M8 significant, BUSTED null | M8 vs M7 inflated by relaxed constraint mimicking selection | Trust BUSTED; check M8a vs M8 instead (stricter null) |
| codeml branch-site significant, aBSREL null | Branch-site test foreground post hoc | aBSREL with built-in multiple-testing is correct; downgrade claim |
| BUSTED significant, MEME no sites | Episodic at sites BUSTED can't pinpoint; or basic BUSTED detected SRV not selection | Run BUSTED-S; if signal vanishes, was SRV; if persists, gene-wide episodic |
| MEME positive, FEL null | Episodic selection (MEME-specific) | Trust MEME for episodic; FEL only detects pervasive |
| Multiple tests positive at same site | High-confidence site under selection | Report; consider experimental validation |
| Test positive but PREQUAL flagged 20% of alignment | Alignment artifact | Re-filter (HmmCleaner); re-test; downgrade if positive site is in filtered region |
| Test positive but in high-recombination region | gBGC | W->S substitution test; if gBGC-attributable, downgrade |
| BUSTED-MH null where BUSTED significant | Multi-hit substitutions misattributed | Trust BUSTED-MH; original positive was multi-hit pattern |
| RELAX k > 1 with branch-site test null | Selection regime intensification (more purifying) | RELAX captures regime shift; branch-site missed because foreground different |
| Branch-site significant on Drosophila branch but no signal in mammals | Lineage-specific adaptation; or dS saturation in mammals | Inspect dS distribution; if mammals dS < 0.5 across branch, signal is real; if dS > 2, saturation explanation |
| asymptotic alpha < 0 | DFE has high deleterious load; or demographic violation | Check polyDFE / GRAPES with demographic correction |

**Operational rule for publication:** GARD pre-screen documented as negative + PREQUAL/HmmCleaner filtering applied + dS < 1.5 per branch + W->S ratio not elevated + BUSTED-MH significant (gene-wide) + MEME flags sites + aBSREL flags branches with consistent direction = publication-ready evidence. Single-method significance (especially M8 vs M7 alone) should be downgraded.

## Cohort Gotchas

- **Immune / MHC loci:** intra-genic recombination is high; GARD pre-screen mandatory; high apparent positive selection often reflects gene conversion between alleles, not adaptive change
- **Viral genomes:** rapid evolution + recombination + multi-hit substitutions common; BUSTED-MH and FUBAR-MH essential; use RDP5 for recombination detection
- **Plasmodium / Trypanosoma:** high codon-usage bias and multi-hit substitutions; use BUSTED-MH and BUSTED-S
- **Mammalian X-chromosome:** higher dS than autosomes (male-driven evolution); gBGC asymmetry by chromosome; reduce dS threshold for X-linked genes
- **Recent human / population genetics:** dS dramatically underestimated at recent divergence; use SFS-based methods (asymptotic alpha, polyDFE)
- **Convergent evolution traits (echolocation, marine):** RERconverge / CSUBST / PhyloAcc-noncoding designed for these; codon-based methods alone miss the convergent signal

## Anticipated Reviewer Pushback

| Pushback | Standard response |
|----------|-------------------|
| "GARD pre-screen?" | Yes; no breakpoints (or partitioned at p < 0.05 breakpoints); per-segment results consistent |
| "Alignment filtering?" | PRANK codon-aware MSA; PREQUAL segment filter applied; Guidance2 scores reported |
| "Saturation?" | dS distribution shown; max per-branch dS < 1.5; analysis restricted to subclades meeting this |
| "Branch-site test foreground post hoc?" | Foreground pre-registered OR exploratory analysis acknowledged + aBSREL with built-in multiple-testing used |
| "Multiple-testing correction?" | FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) across genes; per-site within gene not corrected (dependence) |
| "gBGC?" | W->S substitution ratio not elevated; non-sub-telomeric; BUSTED-MH null in candidates rules out |
| "Multi-hit?" | BUSTED-MH used; if signal persists, robust to multi-hit confounder |
| "Why this LRT df?" | Branch-site test uses 50:50 mixture (Self-Liang 1987; Zhang 2005); critical value 2.71 at p=0.05 |
| "Sensitivity to model choice?" | Cross-validated PAML vs HyPhy; consistent across both; reported both p-values |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| codeml runs but rst file empty | `RateAncestor = 0` or path not writable | Set `RateAncestor = 1`; check output directory |
| codeml omega2 = 999 | Numerical pathology / saturated dS | Vary starting omega; reduce taxon sampling to dS < 2 |
| codeml LRT negative (-0.001) | Numerical noise at convergence | Round; treat as no signal; rerun with different starting values |
| HyPhy "tree branches don't match alignment" | Mismatched taxa names | Use exact same labels in tree and alignment |
| HyPhy MEME returns "no sites significant" | High alignment uncertainty; or no episodic selection | Re-filter alignment; try BUSTED-S for gene-wide signal |
| GARD takes forever | > 50 sequences | Reduce to representative subset; or use RDP5 for viral data |
| MK alpha negative | Demographic issue or DFE has many slightly deleterious | Use polyDFE / GRAPES with demography correction |
| RERconverge "too few species per gene" | Stringent default | Reduce `min.sp = 5`; document |
| CSUBST omega_C unstable | Few combinations; small clade | Need >= 5 clades for stable convergence estimate |
| PhyloAcc convergence failure | Insufficient lineages | Re-run with relaxed prior; check input MAF distribution |
