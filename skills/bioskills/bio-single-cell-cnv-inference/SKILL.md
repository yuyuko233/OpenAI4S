# Copy-Number Inference from Single-Cell RNA-seq

**"Which cells are tumor, and what CNVs and subclones do they carry?"** -> Estimate large-scale copy-number from smoothed expression across genomic windows, compare against a normal reference, and cluster cells into malignant vs normal and into subclones.
- R (reference-based, expression-only): `inferCNV` - smooth expression along chromosomes against a defined normal reference, optional HMM for discrete CNV states
- R (reference-free, expression-only): `copyKAT`, `SCEVAN` - estimate the diploid baseline internally and segment, then classify aneuploid vs diploid
- R (haplotype-aware, allele + expression): `Numbat` - add phased B-allele frequency for the best subclone and copy-neutral-LOH resolution

## Governing principle

Averaged expression over a genomic window is a PROXY for DNA copy number, not a measurement of it. A chromosome-arm gain raises the average expression of the many genes sitting on that arm, and a loss lowers it, so smoothing expression across long runs of contiguous genes reconstructs a coarse copy-number landscape. Three consequences follow and drive every decision. First, the signal is noisy and indirect: it must be smoothed over windows of dozens to hundreds of neighboring genes, and its resolution is chromosome-arm or large-segment (around 5 Mb), never focal genes or exons - this is the hard line separating it from DNA-based copy-number (copy-number/cnvkit-analysis, copy-number/gatk-cnv), which measures DNA read depth and resolves focal amplifications and deletions. Second, the value is RELATIVE: copy-number is only defined against a copy-neutral baseline, so a NORMAL reference is required, and the choice of that reference is the single most consequential decision - a wrong or mismatched reference fabricates CNVs out of ordinary cell-type expression differences. Third, calling a cell malignant is a CLUSTERING decision on this noisy proxy, so it is a hypothesis that needs orthogonal support (lineage markers, mutations, allele evidence), and subclone calls are even softer hypotheses.

Tumor CNV profiles are patient-PRIVATE, so CNV inference runs PER SAMPLE / per patient. Integrating or batch-correcting cells across patients before inference mixes distinct private karyotypes and erases the per-patient signal the analysis depends on (single-cell/batch-integration notes this). Integrate across patients only for shared transcriptional-state analysis, never as input to CNV calling.

CNV-quiet tumors are invisible to this approach. Many hematologic and low-grade tumors carry little large-scale CNV, so expression-based inference returns a near-flat profile - absence of inferred CNV is NOT evidence that cells are normal, and a confident malignant call then requires allele evidence or orthogonal markers. Balanced whole-genome doubling is invisible for the same reason and to all expression methods, not just copyKAT: per-cell library-size normalization removes a uniform ploidy multiple, so a 4N WGD reads copy-neutral against a 2N reference for inferCNV and Numbat's expression channel alike, and only allele or ploidy evidence reveals it.

## Choosing a CNV-inference method

| Method | Model / assumption | Reference | Allele-aware | Use when | Fails when |
|--------|--------------------|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| inferCNV | Smooth expression along chromosomes vs a normal reference; optional HMM for discrete states | Reference-based (needs normal cells) | No | A clean in-sample normal reference exists; want interpretable arm-level heatmap + HMM states | No trustworthy reference; CNV-quiet tumor; needs focal resolution |
| copyKAT | Bayesian segmentation + hierarchical clustering + GMM; estimates diploid baseline internally | Reference-free (optional known normals) | No | No reference cells annotated; want a quick aneuploid-vs-diploid call at ~5 Mb | Mostly-aneuploid sample with no diploid baseline; whole-genome doubling confuses the root |
| SCEVAN | Variational multichannel segmentation sharing breakpoints across a clone | Reference-free | No | Want automatic malignant/non-malignant + subclones in one call | Same baseline ambiguity as copyKAT; very sparse data |
| Numbat | Joint expression + phased B-allele frequency + population haplotypes; iterative phylogeny | Reference (expression) + population phasing | Yes | Best subclone resolution needed; copy-neutral LOH matters; allele counts obtainable | No BAM/phasing available; very low SNP coverage (shallow or snRNA) |

Reference-based (inferCNV, Numbat expression side) is the most reliable when a clean normal reference is available; reference-free (copyKAT, SCEVAN) trades that for not needing one but is vulnerable to baseline ambiguity. Expression-only methods (inferCNV, copyKAT, SCEVAN) are simpler and need only counts; the allele-aware method (Numbat) is the most powerful for subclones and copy-neutral events but requires per-cell allele counts and phasing. Run an expression method to get the malignant/normal split, then Numbat when subclone structure is the question, and reconcile. When methods compete, verify current best practice against the installed package documentation before committing to one.

## Choosing the normal reference

**Goal:** Pick a copy-neutral baseline that defines what "no CNV" looks like, since the reference choice determines whether the inferred CNVs are real or artifacts.

**Approach:** Prefer non-malignant cells from the SAME sample (T cells, B cells, myeloid, endothelial, fibroblasts identified by lineage markers) because they share the patient, protocol, and ambient-RNA background; fall back to an external normal only when no in-sample normals exist, and expect batch artifacts.

The reference cells must be confidently non-malignant and abundant enough for a stable baseline mean: aim for tens to hundreds of reference cells, not a handful, because a few cells give a noisy baseline that fabricates CNVs in every observation cell. A reference that is itself a malignant or stressed population, or a single mismatched cell type, will make every other cell look aneuploid relative to it. The reference must also MATCH the tumor's sex: because inferCNV works on expression, X-inactivation dosage-compensates most chrX expression so there is no uniform two-fold chrX shift, but an external or cross-individual normal (including shipped or pooled-donor references) of the opposite sex still fabricates a convincing uniform sex-chromosome CNV through chrY genes present in XY versus near-absent in XX, XIST high in XX versus silent in XY, and the attenuated X-inactivation escape genes - match sexes or drop chrX and chrY before inference. With no annotated normals, use a reference-free method (copyKAT, SCEVAN) rather than guessing a reference; do not pass tumor-contaminated cells as the reference.

## inferCNV - reference-based expression smoothing

**Goal:** Build a chromosome-ordered expression heatmap against a defined normal reference and call discrete CNV states per region.

**Approach:** Assemble a raw counts matrix, a cell-to-group annotation file, and a gene-ordering file with genomic coordinates, name the normal groups as the reference, then run with droplet-appropriate cutoff, denoising, and the HMM.

```r
library(infercnv)

infercnv_obj <- CreateInfercnvObject(
    raw_counts_matrix = 'counts.matrix',
    annotations_file = 'cell_annotations.txt',
    delim = '\t',
    gene_order_file = 'gene_ordering.txt',
    ref_group_names = c('Tcell', 'Myeloid'))

infercnv_obj <- infercnv::run(
    infercnv_obj,
    cutoff = 0.1,
    out_dir = 'infercnv_out',
    cluster_by_groups = TRUE,
    denoise = TRUE,
    HMM = TRUE,
    num_threads = 4)
```

`ref_group_names` lists the normal groups from the annotation file; set it to `NULL` only when no reference exists (less reliable). `cutoff = 0.1` suits 10x and other droplet data; use `cutoff = 1` for full-length Smart-seq. `cluster_by_groups = TRUE` clusters within annotated groups rather than forcing one global tree. The HMM (`HMM_type = 'i6'` default, six copy states; `'i3'` for a simpler deletion/neutral/amplification model) yields per-region discrete states under `out_dir`.

## copyKAT - reference-free aneuploid vs diploid

**Goal:** Classify cells as aneuploid (tumor) or diploid (normal) without an annotated reference, and obtain a per-cell copy-number matrix.

**Approach:** Pass the raw gene-by-cell matrix; copyKAT estimates the diploid baseline by segmentation and clustering, then labels each cell, optionally anchored by any known-normal barcodes.

```r
library(copykat)

res <- copykat(
    rawmat = exp_rawdata,
    id.type = 'S',
    ngene.chr = 5,
    win.size = 25,
    KS.cut = 0.1,
    sam.name = 'tumor1',
    distance = 'euclidean',
    norm.cell.names = '',
    genome = 'hg20',
    n.cores = 4)

pred <- res$prediction
cna <- res$CNAmat
```

`res$prediction$copykat.pred` is `aneuploid`, `diploid`, or `not.defined` per cell; `res$CNAmat` holds smoothed copy-number values in ~220 kb bins (the output bin size; effective detection resolution is still ~5 Mb). `KS.cut` controls segmentation stringency (raise it for fewer, larger segments). Supplying confident normal barcodes via `norm.cell.names` anchors the diploid baseline and improves accuracy when the sample is mostly aneuploid.

## Numbat - haplotype-aware allele + expression

**Goal:** Resolve subclones and copy-neutral LOH by combining smoothed expression with phased B-allele frequencies.

**Approach:** Generate per-cell allele counts and population phasing with the `pileup_and_phase.R` preprocessing script, build an expression reference from matched normals (or the shipped `ref_hca`), then run the joint model.

```bash
Rscript pileup_and_phase.R --label tumor1 --samples tumor1 \
    --bams tumor1.bam --barcodes barcodes.tsv \
    --gmap genetic_map_hg38_withX.txt.gz --snpvcf genome1K.phase3.SNP.vcf \
    --paneldir 1000G_panel/ --outdir numbat_out/ --ncores 8
```

```r
library(numbat)

ref <- aggregate_counts(count_mat_normal, cell_annot)
out <- run_numbat(
    count_mat,
    lambdas_ref = ref,
    df_allele = df_allele,
    genome = 'hg38',
    t = 1e-5,
    ncores = 4,
    plot = TRUE,
    out_dir = 'numbat_out')

nb <- Numbat$new(out_dir = 'numbat_out')
```

`df_allele` is the allele dataframe written by `pileup_and_phase.R` (columns include `cell`, `snp_id`, `CHROM`, `POS`, `AD`, `DP`, `GT`). `lambdas_ref` is a gene-by-cell-type expression reference from `aggregate_counts(count_mat, cell_annot)` where `cell_annot` has `cell` and `group` columns, or the package-shipped `ref_hca`. `t` is the HMM transition probability. The loaded `Numbat` object exposes `clone_post` (clone assignments) and per-cell copy-number posteriors. Numbat needs no paired-normal DNA but does need a BAM and phasing reference.

## Turning the inferCNV heatmap into per-cell malignant calls

**Goal:** Get a per-cell malignant-vs-normal label from inferCNV, which (unlike copyKAT and SCEVAN) returns a heatmap and HMM region states but no automatic per-cell class.

**Approach:** Subcluster the observation cells on their CNV signal and/or compute a per-cell CNV score, then threshold; carry the result onto the cells with `add_to_seurat` and validate the cut against lineage markers and allele/mutation evidence.

```r
infercnv_obj <- infercnv::run(
    infercnv_obj, cutoff = 0.1, out_dir = 'infercnv_out',
    cluster_by_groups = FALSE, analysis_mode = 'subclusters',
    denoise = TRUE, HMM = TRUE, num_threads = 4)

seurat_obj <- infercnv::add_to_seurat(
    seurat_obj = seurat_obj, infercnv_output_path = 'infercnv_out', top_n = 10)

obs <- read.table('infercnv_out/infercnv.observations.txt', header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
cnv_score <- colSums((obs - 1)^2)
malignant <- cnv_score > quantile(cnv_score, 0.5)
```

`analysis_mode = 'subclusters'` (with `cluster_by_groups = FALSE`) partitions the observation cells by CNV signal so a malignant subcluster separates from a copy-neutral one. The per-cell CNV score (sum of squared deviation of the denoised `infercnv.observations.txt` profile from the copy-neutral value, or each cell's correlation to the mean putative-tumor profile) gives a continuous malignancy axis to threshold; `add_to_seurat` writes per-cell and per-chromosome CNA metadata back onto the object for plotting. The malignant/normal cut is a hypothesis: confirm it against lineage markers (single-cell/cell-annotation) and allele or mutation evidence, never treat the threshold as ground truth.

## Threshold and parameter reference

| Parameter | Tool | Default / typical | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-------------------|-----------|
| cutoff | inferCNV | 0.1 (droplet), 1 (Smart-seq) | Drops genes below mean expression; droplet data are sparse so the threshold is lower |
| HMM_type | inferCNV | i6 | Six copy states (0 to 3+) give finer state calls; i3 (del/neutral/amp) is simpler and more robust |
| ref_group_names | inferCNV | named normals | The copy-neutral baseline; NULL only when no reference exists, at a reliability cost |
| ngene.chr | copyKAT | 5 | Minimum genes per chromosome per cell so a cell has signal on each chromosome |
| win.size | copyKAT | 25 | Genes per segment for smoothing; larger windows denoise but blur small events |
| KS.cut | copyKAT | 0.1 | Segmentation stringency; raise for fewer, larger segments in noisy data |
| genome | copyKAT | hg20 | Must match the assembly the gene coordinates came from (hg20 or mm10) |
| t | Numbat | 1e-5 | HMM transition probability; lower favors longer segments |
| resolution (~5 Mb) | all expression methods | ~5 Mb | The floor of expression-based CNV; focal events below this are invisible |

## Common Errors

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Every cell looks aneuploid, including the immune cells | Reference cells are tumor-contaminated or a mismatched cell type | Re-pick confident non-malignant in-sample normals by lineage markers; do not use a stressed/malignant population as reference |
| Flat profile, no CNVs called, but cells are clearly tumor | CNV-quiet / low-grade tumor, or snRNA sparsity | Absence of CNV is not normality; switch to allele-aware Numbat or confirm malignancy with markers/mutations |
| copyKAT cannot find a diploid baseline / labels almost all aneuploid | Mostly-aneuploid sample with no internal diploid cells, or balanced whole-genome doubling that library-size normalization hides | Supply known-normal barcodes via `norm.cell.names`, or use inferCNV with an external reference; confirm ploidy with allele/DNA evidence since balanced WGD looks copy-neutral to all expression methods |
| Uniform chrX gain/loss and a chrY call across all tumor cells | Reference and tumor are opposite sex (external/shipped/pooled-donor reference) | Match reference and tumor sex, or drop chrX and chrY before inference |
| Recurrent localized segment over 6p, 14q, 22q, or 2p that tracks lineage | High, variable HLA (MHC 6p) and immunoglobulin/TCR expression clusters genomically and mimics a segment, especially with immune references | Mask or distrust segments over HLA and Ig/TCR loci; do not call them CNV |
| Stripe artifacts that track proliferating cells | Cell-cycle and high-expression gene programs mimic CNV | Account for / regress cell cycle, enable denoising, and treat cycle-correlated bands skeptically |
| Subclones from inferCNV/copyKAT do not replicate | Expression-only subclone calls are weak hypotheses | Confirm with Numbat allele evidence or DNA; report subclones as hypotheses |
| CNV signal vanishes after integrating samples | Cross-patient integration erased patient-private karyotypes | Run CNV inference per sample BEFORE any cross-patient integration |
| Genes silently dropped / wrong chromosome bands | Gene-order file or genome build mismatched to the counts | Match `gene_order_file` and `genome` to the same assembly and gene IDs as the matrix |
