## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: riborex 2.4+, xtail 1.1+, anota2seq 1.24+, DESeq2 1.42+, pandas 2.2+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Translation Efficiency

**"Calculate translation efficiency from my Ribo-seq and RNA-seq"** -> Compute footprint density relative to mRNA density per gene and test which genes change translation independently of transcription, distinguishing real translational control from buffering.
- R: `riborex` (DESeq2/edgeR backend), `Xtail`, or `anota2seq` for differential TE
- Python: per-gene TE ratio for ranking/visualization only

TE = RPF density / mRNA density over the SAME region. Both assays must come from matched samples and be counted over the CDS. TE isolates translational regulation and is a relative translation-rate proxy at steady state; occupancy is not protein output.

## The central trap: a ratio is for ranking, not testing

The naive per-gene ratio (TPM_ribo/TPM_rna) is fine for ranking and plots but WRONG for differential testing: it ignores count heteroskedasticity, treating a gene with 5 reads like one with 5000. Differential TE is NOT "compute TE per condition then test the difference" -- it is a CONDITION x ASSAY INTERACTION on raw counts with proper negative-binomial dispersion modeling, where log2FC(TE) = log2FC(RPF) - log2FC(mRNA). The whole differential-TE field exists to do this interaction correctly.

## Mode of regulation: control vs buffering

When both assays move, there are distinct biological modes that a single TE fold-change cannot separate:

| Mode | RPF | mRNA | TE | Meaning |
|------|-----|------|-----|---------|
| mRNA abundance | up | up | ~flat | transcriptional, not translational |
| translation (forwarded) | up | flat | up | genuine translational control -> protein changes |
| buffering | flat | up | down | translation absorbs the mRNA change, protein held constant |

Buffering (a homeostatic mechanism) and genuine translational activation can produce the SAME |log2FC(TE)|. Calling a buffered gene "translationally activated" is a wrong conclusion. Only anota2seq formally names the mode, by regressing translated mRNA on total mRNA (analysis of partial variance).

## Differential-TE tool selection

| Tool | Statistic | Names buffering | Best when |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| riborex | wraps DESeq2/edgeR/Voom on a merged interaction design | no | fast drop-in for DESeq2 users |
| Xtail | two pipelines (FC-vs-FC, ratio-vs-ratio), reports the more conservative | partial (won't call a buffered gene a hit) | conservative differential-TE calls + clean plots |
| anota2seq | per-mRNA APV + random variance model | YES | mode-of-regulation biology; the postdoc-grade choice |
| RiboDiff | NB GLM, shared dispersion by default | no | few replicates; CLI pipeline |
| DESeq2 interaction | ~assay+condition+assay:condition, Wald or LRT | no (post-hoc) | full control, custom contrasts, batch terms |

## Quick per-gene TE (ranking screen only)

**Goal:** Rank genes by TE for a quick look, not for inference.

**Approach:** Normalize both assays, take the log2 ratio over the CDS with a pseudocount.

```python
import numpy as np

def log2_te(ribo_cds_tpm, rna_cds_tpm, pseudocount=0.1):
    '''Per-gene log2 TE for ranking/plots. Both inputs counted over the CDS.

    Pseudocount 0.1 TPM avoids log(0) and dampens low-count noise. Not for testing.
    '''
    return np.log2((ribo_cds_tpm + pseudocount) / (rna_cds_tpm + pseudocount))
```

Count BOTH assays over the CDS. Using full-transcript RNA against CDS-only RPF introduces a UTR-length confound (long-UTR genes look low-TE). Exclude the first ~15 and last ~5 codons of the CDS so initiation and termination peaks do not dominate the RPF count.

## Differential TE with riborex

**Goal:** Test differential TE reusing a familiar DE engine.

**Approach:** Pass CDS count matrices and condition vectors; riborex builds the interaction design internally and returns DESeq2-format results.

```r
library(riborex)

# rna_counts / ribo_counts: genes x samples integer CDS counts
res <- riborex(rnaCntTable = rna_counts, riboCntTable = ribo_counts,
               rnaCond = c("ctrl", "ctrl", "treat", "treat"),
               riboCond = c("ctrl", "ctrl", "treat", "treat"),
               engine = "DESeq2")
sig <- res[which(res$padj < 0.05), ]   # log2FoldChange is the TE change
```

Engines are `"DESeq2"` (default), `"edgeR"`, `"edgeRD"`, `"Voom"` (Voom is single-factor only).

## Differential TE with anota2seq (names the mode)

**Goal:** Separate translation, buffering, and mRNA-abundance regulation.

**Approach:** Provide translated (RPF) and total (RNA) matrices, run the pipeline, then classify each gene's mode.

```r
library(anota2seq)

ads <- anota2seqDataSetFromMatrix(dataP = ribo_counts, dataT = rna_counts,
                                  phenoVec = c("ctrl", "ctrl", "treat", "treat"),
                                  dataType = "RNAseq", normalize = TRUE)
ads <- anota2seqRun(ads, useRVM = TRUE)
ads <- anota2seqRegModes(ads)   # one mode per gene: translation > abundance > buffering
translation_hits <- anota2seqGetOutput(ads, analysis = "translation",
                                       output = "selected", selContrast = 1)
```

## Differential TE with a DESeq2 interaction

**Goal:** Full control over the interaction model.

**Approach:** Merge RPF and RNA counts, fit the interaction, and select the interaction coefficient by name from `resultsNames` (never hardcode it).

```r
library(DESeq2)
counts <- cbind(ribo_counts, rna_counts)
coldata <- data.frame(
    condition = factor(rep(c("ctrl", "ctrl", "treat", "treat"), 2)),
    assay = factor(rep(c("ribo", "rna"), each = 4)))
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts, coldata, ~ assay + condition + assay:condition)
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# The interaction name is auto-generated from factor levels; pick it programmatically.
# DESeq2 renders interaction coefficients with a DOT (e.g. assayrna.conditiontreat),
# while main effects use underscores -- so match the dot, not the formula's colon.
nm <- grep("\\.", resultsNames(dds), value = TRUE)
res_te <- results(dds, name = nm)
```

Size factors are estimated PER ASSAY (ribo among ribo, RNA among RNA); the implicit assumption is that the median gene's TE is unchanged. If a global translational shift is expected (e.g. mTOR inhibition), median normalization is violated and spike-ins are needed to anchor absolute scale.

## Confounders to check

mRNA isoform switching changes the CDS/UTR counting region between conditions; UTR changes that alter uORF usage can make a main-ORF TE change SECONDARY to uORF regulation rather than direct translational control. Cross-check called ORFs and uORFs (see orf-detection) before attributing a TE shift to the main ORF.

## Common Errors

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Low-count genes dominate the hit list | t-test/ratio on log-TE | Use count-based GLM (riborex/Xtail/anota2seq/DESeq2) |
| Long-UTR genes systematically low TE | RNA counted over full transcript, RPF over CDS | Count both over the CDS |
| `results(dds, name='conditiontreat.assayribo')` errors | Hardcoded interaction name | Select from `resultsNames(dds)` by the "." term (interaction coefficients render with a dot, not the formula's colon) |
| Unstable dispersion or anota2seq RVM warnings | Too few replicates (n=2 as in the examples) | Use >=3 replicates per condition per assay; n=2 is illustrative only |
| Buffered gene reported as translationally activated | Single TE fold-change cannot separate modes | Use anota2seq mode-of-regulation |
| TE shifts vanish or invert globally | Global translational change breaks median normalization | Add spike-ins; do not assume median TE unchanged |
| Initiation peak inflates RPF counts | Whole-CDS counting including start/stop peaks | Trim first ~15 / last ~5 codons |
