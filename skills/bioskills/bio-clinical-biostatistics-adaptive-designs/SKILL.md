## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: R `rpact` 4.2+ (Wassmer/Brannath), `gsDesign` 3.6+ and `gsDesign2` 1.1+ (Anderson/Merck), `adaptr`, `simtrial`. Commercial: East/EastHorizon (Cytel), ADDPLAN (ICON), FACTS (Berry Consultants).

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name`
- Python adaptive packages are limited; R is the regulatory de facto standard

If code throws an error, introspect the installed package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Adaptive Clinical Trial Designs

**"Design an adaptive trial"** -> Pre-specify a design with one or more interim adaptations (early stopping, sample-size re-estimation, treatment selection, population enrichment, randomisation ratio changes) that strongly controls Type-I error at the trial-wide level via combination tests or the Conditional Rejection Probability principle.

## Regulatory Status -- The 2024-2026 Landscape

**FDA 2019 Final Adaptive Designs Guidance** (Federal Register 2019-25986, Dec 2 2019) finalised the 2010 and 2018 drafts. Recognises 5 design types: group-sequential, blinded SSR, unblinded SSR, adaptive enrichment, adaptive randomisation.

**FDA 2022 Final Master Protocols Guidance** (March 2022, NOT 2018 — common citation error): basket (one drug, many diseases), umbrella (multiple drugs, one disease), platform (perpetual, drugs enter/exit).

**ICH E20 Adaptive Clinical Trials**: **Step 2b draft June 25 2025; Step 3 public consultation (EU deadline Nov 30 2025; FDA Federal Register Sept 30 2025); Step 4 final expected in 2026.** As of May 2026, ICH E20 is NOT final. The EFPIA/PhRMA position paper preceded the formal ICH work; Berry Consultants public comment letter is one of the more important submissions.

**FDA CDER Bayesian Methodology Draft (Jan 2026)** (FDA-2025-D-3217): first-ever drug-side Bayesian guidance; permits Bayesian primary inference in pivotals with simulation-based Type-I error calibration.

**Project Optimus (FDA OCE, 2021-2024)**: rewrites Phase I/II oncology by requiring randomised dose comparison before registration, replacing MTD-and-go. Made BOIN, mTPI-2, and multi-arm dose-finding the default.

## Group-Sequential Designs

### O'Brien-Fleming -- the regulatory default

```r
library(gsDesign)

# OBF boundaries; 3 interim looks at 33%, 67%, 100% information
design <- gsDesign(
    k = 4,                  # total analyses including final
    test.type = 1,          # 1-sided efficacy
    alpha = 0.025,
    beta = 0.10,            # power = 0.90
    sfu = sfLDOF,           # Lan-DeMets approximation of OBF
    timing = c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0)
)
print(design)
plot(design)
```

OBF is **very conservative at early looks** (nominal alpha approximately 0.0001 at 25% info) and **near-nominal at final analysis** (~0.024 of 0.025). Preferred by FDA because the final-analysis penalty is small.

### Pocock -- constant nominal

Constant nominal alpha at each look. Easy early stopping but large final-analysis penalty (~0.018 of 0.025 with k=4). Rarely used in confirmatory.

### Lan-DeMets spending function -- the modern flexibility

```r
# Lan-DeMets OBF-like spending function (sfLDOF)
# Allows analysis timing to differ from pre-specified
design_flex <- gsDesign(
    k = 3,
    sfu = sfLDOF,      # OBF-like spending
    alpha = 0.025,
    beta = 0.10
)

# Actual analyses can occur at different information fractions
# Spending function returns alpha to spend at each look based on actual timing
```

**The flexibility:** sponsor can perform analyses at different information fractions than originally planned. FDA's de facto preferred framework.

### Sample-size for group-sequential

```r
# Time-to-event group-sequential
library(gsDesign)
n_gs <- gsSurv(
    k = 3,
    test.type = 2,    # 2-sided
    alpha = 0.025,
    beta = 0.10,
    sfu = sfLDOF,
    lambdaC = 0.04,   # control hazard per month
    hr = 0.70,        # treatment HR
    eta = 0.005,      # dropout hazard
    T = 24,           # total study duration
    minfup = 12       # minimum follow-up
)
print(n_gs)
```

## Sample-Size Re-Estimation

### Blinded SSR (Friede-Kieser 2006)

Re-estimate nuisance parameter (variance σ² for continuous, control event rate p_0 for binary, overall event rate for survival) from blinded interim data. **No Type-I error inflation when test statistic ignores the SSR.**

```r
library(rpact)
# Blinded SSR for continuous outcome
design_blinded_ssr <- getDesignGroupSequential(
    kMax = 2,
    alpha = 0.025,
    beta = 0.20,
    sided = 1,
    informationRates = c(0.5, 1)
)

# At interim, re-estimate variance and recompute n
# (manual implementation; rpact has built-in support via getDesignInverseNormal for unblinded)
```

EMA Reflection Paper 2007 and FDA 2019 explicitly endorse blinded SSR. **Uncontroversial.**

### Unblinded SSR (Cui-Hung-Wang 1999)

Interim effect estimate triggers sample-size change. **Type-I inflation if naive:** Cui-Hung-Wang showed 8% Type-I vs 2.5% target.

The Cui-Hung-Wang weighted test uses pre-specified weights from the original design:

```
Z_weighted = w_1 * Z_1 + w_2 * Z_2_residual
```

where w_1, w_2 are the pre-specified weights (based on original n_1, n_2) and Z_2_residual is the test statistic on the data after the interim. **Pre-specified weights preserve alpha** even if the actual n at stage 2 differs.

```r
library(rpact)
design_unblinded_ssr <- getDesignInverseNormal(
    kMax = 2,
    alpha = 0.025,
    beta = 0.20,
    sided = 1,
    informationRates = c(0.5, 1),
    typeOfDesign = 'WT',  # Wang-Tsiatis power family
    deltaWT = 0.25
)

# Use inverse normal combination for adaptive SSR
analysis_result <- getAnalysisResults(
    design_unblinded_ssr,
    dataInput = getDataMeans(...)
)
```

### Mehta-Pocock Promising Zone (2011)

At interim, compute conditional power (CP) given observed effect:

- **Unfavourable zone** (CP < ~30%): stop or continue without modification
- **Promising zone** (CP in 30-80%): increase n to recover power; NO Type-I penalty if increase rule pre-specified and uses original test statistic with original weights
- **Favourable zone** (CP > 80%): continue without change

```r
# rpact implementation
# Sample size recalculation in promising zone
n_increased <- getSampleSizeMeans(
    design_unblinded_ssr,
    alternative = 5,        # detect mean diff of 5
    stDev = 12,
    groups = 2
)
```

**The mathematical sleight:** promising zone is constructed so unconditional Type-I error inflation is negligible (~0.001) even WITHOUT CHW weighting. **Jennison-Turnbull 2015 critique:** stealth alpha inflation in unpublished simulation assumptions; inefficient relative to CHW-weighted GSD. Mehta defends on operational grounds.

**Edwards et al 2020 *Trials* 21:1000** is the systematic review.

## Combination Tests and CRP Principle

**Bauer-Köhne 1994** *Biometrics* 50:1029: combine stagewise p-values via Fisher's product test. Permits design modifications post-interim while controlling Type-I error.

**Müller-Schäfer 2001** *Biometrics* 57:886: **Conditional Rejection Probability (CRP) principle** — preserve the null conditional rejection probability at every adaptation, and unconditional Type-I is preserved. The theoretical bedrock of all post-2001 confirmatory adaptive designs.

Müller-Schäfer 2004 *Stat Med* 23:2497 extended to ANY design change at ANY time.

```r
# rpact natively supports combination tests
design_comb <- getDesignFisher(
    kMax = 3,
    alpha = 0.025,
    sided = 1
)

# Or inverse normal combination
design_inv_norm <- getDesignInverseNormal(
    kMax = 3,
    alpha = 0.025,
    informationRates = c(0.33, 0.67, 1.0)
)
```

## Adaptive Enrichment

Drop sub-populations failing futility; re-power on responders. **Closed-test stage-wise** to control familywise error across full and enriched populations.

```r
# rpact: enrichment design via getDesignEnrichmentSubgroup
# Standard implementation requires explicit definition of full population (F)
# and enriched population (S)
```

**Postdoc concern:** selection bias on the enriched population — the observed treatment effect on the enriched subgroup is biased upward by selection. Bias-correction via simulation or hierarchical Bayesian.

## Response-Adaptive Randomisation -- The Ethics Fight

**Hey & Kimmelman 2015 *Clin Trials* 12:102 "Are outcome-adaptive allocation trials ethical?"** Argued RAR's purported ethical advantage (equipoise, sub-optimal exposure minimisation) **fails in two-arm and early-phase settings** because:

1. Drift bias inflates Type-I error / biases estimates (time trends confounded with allocation)
2. Consent dynamics confused — patients believe allocation is "personalised" when stochastic
3. Marginal patient-welfare benefit is statistical and small while operational risks real

**Counter-arguments:**

- **Berry DA 2015 commentary** *Clin Trials* 12:107: RAR enables learn-and-confirm, multi-arm platforms (I-SPY 2 model) where the patient-welfare argument IS the point and equal allocation would be unethical given accumulating evidence.
- **Saville & Berry 2016 *Clin Trials* 13:358:** RAR's operating characteristics are competitive in multi-arm platforms. Drift bias and Type-I inflation are controlled by adjusting for temporal trends (time-trend covariates) alongside stratification and proper analysis weights -- the "Bayesian time machine" approach developed in later work.
- **Buyse 2015 *Clin Trials* 12:119:** Hey-Kimmelman correct for 2-arm but wrong for multi-arm.

**Consensus position (2020s; ICH E20):** RAR appropriate when (a) multi-arm (>=3 arms), (b) rare disease / limited pool, (c) strong PoC of differential biomarker response, (d) robust drift-bias adjustment and pre-specified analysis weights. **Inappropriate for confirmatory 2-arm trials.**

**Robertson, Lee, López-Kolkovska, Villar 2023 *Stat Sci* 38:185 ("Response-adaptive randomization: from myths to practical considerations")** is the canonical modern review settling the debate.

## Bayesian Platform Trials

**I-SPY 2 (Barker-Sigman 2009 *Clin Pharmacol Ther*; Park-Liu 2016 *NEJM* 375:11):** neoadjuvant breast cancer; 10 biomarker-defined subtypes × multiple arms; Bayesian RAR; graduation criterion = posterior predictive probability of success in 300-patient Phase 3 ≥ 85%. Berry Consultants designed the engine. Multiple drugs graduated (neratinib, veliparib, pembrolizumab).

**GBM AGILE (Alexander 2018; published readouts beginning 2024):** glioblastoma; response-adaptive Bayesian; first global registrational platform in neuro-oncology. Regorafenib readout 2025 *JCO* JCO-25-01137.

**REMAP-CAP (Angus 2020 *JAMA*):** severe pneumonia, repurposed for COVID-19 in 2020; **Bayesian factorial multi-domain design** — multiple intervention domains tested simultaneously and combinatorially. Generated corticosteroid signal in COVID independently of RECOVERY.

### Drop-the-loser vs promising-the-winner

- **Adaptive arm-dropping (futility):** Bayesian posterior probability of beating control drops below threshold -> arm closes. Mathematically straightforward; FDA-acceptable.
- **"Promising-the-winner" (graduate to Phase 3):** introduces selection bias. Bias-adjusted estimators (Robertson 2023; conditional MLE) now standard in I-SPY 2 reports.

## Phase I Dose-Finding -- BOIN, mTPI, CRM

| Design | Citation | Idea | Where it wins |
|--------|----------|------|---------------|
| CRM | O'Quigley-Pepe-Fisher 1990 | Single-parameter logistic/power model; updates posterior MTD probability after each cohort | Statistically efficient; skeleton calibration needed |
| EWOC | Babb-Rogatko-Zacks 1998 | CRM-like with explicit overdose-control constraint (P(dose > MTD) <= 0.25) | Safer than CRM in small trials |
| mTPI | Ji et al 2010 *Clin Trials* 7:653 | Beta-binomial; UPM decision rule on under/proper/over-dosing intervals | Pre-tabulated decisions; documented over-shoot bias |
| mTPI-2 / Keyboard | Guo-Wang-Yang-Lynn-Ji 2017 | Fixes mTPI Ockham bias by equal-width intervals | Default mTPI replacement |
| BOIN | Liu-Yuan 2015 *J R Stat Soc C* 64:507 | Pre-tabulated escalation interval bounds optimised to minimise incorrect-decision probability | **FDA Fit-for-Purpose qualified Dec 2021**; near-CRM with no bedside software |

**Why FDA prefers BOIN operationally:** qualified as Fit-for-Purpose under FDA's Drug Development Tools program (FDA Determination Letter, December 10, 2021). Investigator uses pre-printed escalation table — no real-time Bayesian software at the bedside.

R packages: `BOIN`, `dfcrm` (Cheung — author of CRM textbook), `trialr` (Brock — includes EffTox), `escalation` (Brock — unified framework).

## Reconciliation: When Methods Disagree

| Pattern | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Blinded SSR n vs unblinded SSR n differ substantially | Unblinded SSR uses interim effect estimate; blinded uses nuisance parameter only | Blinded is Type-I-clean; unblinded requires CHW weighting; pre-specify the approach in SAP |
| Group-sequential rejects at interim; Cui-Hung-Wang weighted final test does not | Naive interim rejection used original test statistic; CHW weights downweight late data | Pre-specify boundary and weights; do NOT switch tests mid-stream |
| Mehta-Pocock promising-zone vs CHW-weighted GSD give different n increases | Promising zone calibrated for Type-I (~0.001 inflation); CHW more efficient under known effect | Jennison-Turnbull 2015 critique: promising zone "stealth alpha"; pre-specify with simulation OCs |
| Adaptive enrichment selects subgroup at interim; replication shows smaller effect | Selection bias on enriched population (winner's curse) | Bias-correction via conditional MLE or hierarchical Bayesian; cite Robertson 2023 |
| RAR posterior allocation favours active in 2-arm trial; randomisation drift bias suspected | Time trends confounded with allocation changes | Pre-specify time-trend covariates in analysis; use proper analysis weights; cite Robertson 2023 RAR consensus (RAR INAPPROPRIATE for 2-arm confirmatory) |
| BOIN vs CRM choose different MTD on same data | CRM uses model; BOIN uses tabulated boundaries; differ when skeleton mis-calibrated | BOIN Fit-for-Purpose qualified (Dec 2021); CRM more efficient under correct skeleton; report OCs over both |
| I-SPY 2 graduation criterion met but Phase 3 replication fails | Selection bias on graduated arm; PP threshold not bias-corrected | Apply conditional MLE; cite Robertson 2023; report both raw and bias-corrected estimates |
| Müller-Schäfer CRP preserved but ad hoc rule appears Type-I-inflated in simulation | Implementation deviation from formal CRP | Verify CRP equation precisely; report OCs via simulation; cite Müller-Schäfer 2001 |

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### Unblinded SSR with naive sample increase

- **Trigger:** Sponsor increases n based on interim effect without CHW weighting.
- **Mechanism:** Type-I inflation up to 8% (Cui-Hung-Wang 1999 simulation).
- **Symptom:** Independent reanalysis finds Type-I > 5%.
- **Fix:** Pre-specify CHW weights from original design; use combination test in rpact.

### Mehta-Pocock promising-zone "stealth alpha"

- **Trigger:** Promising-zone applied without sufficient simulation.
- **Mechanism:** Jennison-Turnbull 2015 critique — Type-I inflation hidden in unpublished simulation assumptions.
- **Symptom:** Independent reanalysis finds Type-I 5.3% vs nominal 5%.
- **Fix:** Pre-specify increase rule transparently; report simulation OCs.

### RAR drift bias

- **Trigger:** RAR in trial with time trends (calendar effects, learning curves).
- **Mechanism:** Time trends confounded with allocation changes; biased effect estimate.
- **Symptom:** Effect estimate sensitive to time-trend adjustment.
- **Fix:** Pre-specify time-trend covariates in analysis; use proper analysis weights; cite Robertson 2023.

### Schoenfeld formula under immunotherapy delayed effect

- **Trigger:** Sample size calculated via Schoenfeld 1981 assuming PH.
- **Mechanism:** Delayed effect violates PH; events under-estimated by 20-50%.
- **Symptom:** Trial under-powered; observed events insufficient.
- **Fix:** Lakatos 1988 or simulation under expected HR(t); cite Lin 2020 NPH Working Group.

### IDMC firewall failure in unblinded SSR (IDMC = Independent Data Monitoring Committee; the regulatory-standard term)

- **Trigger:** Interim effect estimate leaks beyond IDMC.
- **Mechanism:** Sponsor inference from increase decision reveals direction of interim effect.
- **Symptom:** Regulator audit reveals unblinding.
- **Fix:** Strict firewall SOP; only "increase / no increase" communicated to sponsor; cite ICH E20.

### Adaptive enrichment selection bias

- **Trigger:** Enriched population effect reported without bias correction.
- **Mechanism:** Selection on subgroup with promising interim effect inflates estimate.
- **Symptom:** Independent replication on enriched subgroup gives smaller effect.
- **Fix:** Bias-correction via simulation or hierarchical Bayesian; cite Robertson 2023 for bias-adjusted estimation.

### RAR in 2-arm confirmatory

- **Trigger:** RAR applied to confirmatory 2-arm trial.
- **Mechanism:** Hey-Kimmelman 2015 critique — drift bias, consent confusion, marginal benefit.
- **Symptom:** Reviewer rejects RAR as inappropriate for setting.
- **Fix:** Group-sequential with futility/efficacy boundaries instead; cite Robertson 2023 consensus.

### CRM skeleton mis-calibration

- **Trigger:** CRM applied with default skeleton without simulation.
- **Mechanism:** Skeleton dictates target dose; mis-calibration biases MTD.
- **Symptom:** MTD selection differs systematically from clinical expectation.
- **Fix:** Calibrate skeleton via Lee-Cheung 2009 indifference-interval method; or switch to BOIN.

## Anticipated Reviewer Pushback

| Pushback | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "How is Type-I error controlled?" | Closed testing via Müller-Schäfer CRP principle; specific implementation is inverse normal combination test in rpact |
| "Why these boundaries?" | OBF via Lan-DeMets sfLDOF spending function; preserves final-analysis power; pre-specified in SAP |
| "Pre-specification of SSR rule?" | Promising zone CP in (0.3, 0.8) triggers increase to n_max via CHW-weighted statistic; pre-specified n_max in SAP |
| "IDMC firewall?" | IDMC receives interim effect estimate; sponsor receives only "increase / no increase" decision; SOP documented; pre-specified |
| "RAR ethics?" | Multi-arm (4 arms) setting; Berry 2015 consensus that patient-welfare argument valid; drift-bias adjustment in primary analysis |
| "Promising zone vs CHW-weighted GSD?" | Operational simplicity preferred; OCs from simulation confirm Type-I ~5%; supportive Cui-Hung-Wang analysis |
| "Adaptive enrichment bias?" | Bias-correction via simulation; conditional MLE for enriched-population effect; cite Robertson 2023 |
| "Phase 1 BOIN vs CRM?" | BOIN Fit-for-Purpose qualified by FDA Dec 2021; tabulated decisions; no bedside Bayesian software |
