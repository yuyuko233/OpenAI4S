# Statistical analysis contract

This contract applies only to `analysis_mode: comparative`. In descriptive
mode, pseudobulk construction, DE and DA are not run; both structured statuses
are `not_applicable_descriptive`, and no inferential tables or figures are
emitted.

## Unit of replication

Build integer pseudobulk counts from `layers["counts"]` for each
`sample × cluster` or `sample × confirmed_cell_type`. Cells are observations,
not biological replicates. Export library size and cell count for every
pseudobulk unit. With a partial confirmed mapping, unmapped clusters are never
pooled: each keeps its own `Unknown:cluster_<id>` pseudobulk unit, because one
`Unknown` unit would mix distinct populations inside the model's unit of
homogeneity.

Each tested and reference level requires at least three independent donors —
per fitted group, not only study-wide. A group missing either level, or with
fewer than three donors in one, is skipped and recorded; the remaining groups
still run. If the study-wide gate fails, DE and DA become
`skipped_insufficient_replicates`; no inferential p-values are emitted.

## Differential expression

Run PyDESeq2 separately for eligible cell groups. The condition contrast is
explicitly `(condition_key, tested, reference)`. A paired design uses
`~ donor_id + condition`; an unpaired design uses declared covariates followed
by condition. Reject a rank-deficient design. Export baseMean, log2FoldChange,
standard error, statistic, p-value and adjusted p-value with group and contrast
metadata. Positive log2 fold change means tested greater than reference.

## Differential abundance

Milo counts neighborhoods by sample, not by cell. Use Pertpy's `pydeseq2`
solver. Pertpy is not part of the default kernel environment (its core drags
the Flax/NumPyro/ott-jax stack); install the optional `singlecell` extra, or
DA reports `failed_missing_dependency` while the base analysis completes.
The contrast is expressed as the string
`{condition_key}{tested}-{condition_key}{reference}`, which is why preflight
restricts DA level values to letters, digits, underscores, and dots. Include donor as a fixed design covariate for paired data and declared
covariates otherwise. Export logFC, PValue, FDR and SpatialFDR where available.
Milo failure is reported independently of pseudobulk DE and does not invalidate
the base analysis.

These models test the declared contrast only; they do not make causal claims.
