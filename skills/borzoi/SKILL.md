  Predict genome-wide functional tracks (RNA-seq, CAGE, DNase, ChIP) from DNA
  sequence with Borzoi. Use this skill when:
  (1) Scoring the regulatory effect of a variant on expression/accessibility,
  (2) Generating predicted coverage tracks for a locus,
  (3) Prioritising non-coding variants by predicted track delta.

# Borzoi — DNA → Functional Track Prediction

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Python      | 3.10+   | 3.11        |
| CUDA        | 12.1+   | 12.4+       |
| GPU VRAM    | 16 GB   | 24 GB+      |

## How to run

```python
from borzoi_pytorch import Borzoi

model = Borzoi.from_pretrained("johahi/borzoi-replicate-0").cuda().eval()
# input: (batch, 4, 524288) one-hot DNA  → output: (batch, tracks, 6144) bins
```

Borzoi consumes ~524 kb one-hot windows and emits binned predictions across
7,611 human tracks (the separate 2,608-track mouse head is off by default;
enable via `enable_mouse_head=True` and select with
`forward(..., is_human=False)`). For variant scoring, run ref/alt windows
centred on the variant and compare per-track output.

## Output format

`(B, T, L)` tensor — `T` tracks × `L` 32-bp bins. Track metadata (assay,
biosample) is in `borzoi_pytorch.pytorch_borzoi_model.TRACKS_DF` (or `model.tracks_df` when using the `AnnotatedBorzoi` subclass) — the base `Borzoi` model has no `targets` attribute.


## Remote compute

Needs ≥24 GB VRAM and either pre-cached HF weights or egress to
`huggingface.co`. Read `compute_details({provider, mode:'read'})` for an
environment with `borzoi-pytorch`, then:

```python
c = host.compute.create(provider)
job = c.submit_job(
    intent="Borzoi track prediction for 1 locus — 1×GPU, ~2 min",
    inputs=[{"src": "borzoi_run.py", "dst_filename": "borzoi_run.py"}],
    command="python3 borzoi_run.py",   # env selection is host-specific — see compute_details for your provider
    outputs=["tracks.npz"],
    timeout_seconds=1800,
)
print(job.job_id)   # cell ends here — kernel never blocks on compute
```

Then poll from a later cell. `.result()` is one non-blocking probe of the
remote and is what harvests the outputs once the job is terminal — nothing
runs in the background, so a job you never poll is never harvested. While the
job is still running it returns `{"status": "running", …}`; end the cell and
call it again later:

```python
r = c.attach_job(job_id).result()   # {status, exit_code, output_files,
                                    #  featured_files, remote_workdir, …}
if r["status"] == "succeeded":
    for path in r["featured_files"]:      # paths under hpc/<job_id>/
        host.save_artifact(path)
    c.close()
# `unknown` is not a finished job — poll again rather than closing over it.
```

See the `remote-compute-ssh` / `remote-compute-nvidia` skill for the
orchestration details.

If the provider exposes a weight-cache mount, point `HF_HOME` at it inside
`borzoi_run.py` (path is in `compute_details`).


## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                        | Cause                    | Fix                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `module has no __version__`    | Package exposes no attr  | Use `importlib.metadata.version("borzoi-pytorch")` |
| Shape mismatch on input        | Wrong window length      | Pad/crop to 524288 bp (fixed; not exposed as a model attribute) |

**Next**: combine track deltas with `evo2` likelihood deltas for a
two-axis variant prioritisation.
