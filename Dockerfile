# OpenAI4S — container image for the daemon + web workbench.
#
# Build:  docker build -t openai4s:local .
# Run:    docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8760:8760 -v openai4s-data:/data openai4s:local
#
# Read docs/docker.md before exposing this beyond loopback. Two properties of
# this image are decisions rather than defaults:
#
#   * It binds 0.0.0.0 *inside the container's own network namespace*, which is
#     the only address a published port can reach. That is not the same as
#     exposing the daemon on a network: what you publish the port to is. A
#     non-loopback bind also makes the access token mandatory and unremovable
#     (gateway.py: `_needs_token = (not _loopback) or ...`), so the token — not
#     the Host-header allowlist, which a wildcard bind necessarily turns off —
#     is the control standing between a caller and endpoints that execute code.
#
#   * It selects the environment-injection secret backend. Credentials arrive
#     as `OPENAI4S_SECRET_<SCOPE>_<NAME>` and nothing credential-shaped is ever
#     written to the volume, which is stronger than the keychain a container
#     cannot have rather than a fallback from it. `auto` would fail closed here
#     — correctly, since storing a key unprotected must be a decision — but
#     failing closed also means a `SecretStoreUnavailable` traceback ahead of
#     the startup banner on every boot, for a migration with nothing to
#     migrate. Choosing the backend that a server actually has removes the
#     noise without weakening anything. See docs/docker.md.

# --- build stage: turn this tree into the same wheel CI builds ---------------
#
# Not a `pip install .` of the source tree, and not `pip install openai4s` from
# PyPI: the published 0.1.0 predates this tree while carrying the same version
# string, so an image built from the index would be silently older than the
# checkout it was built in. Building the wheel here is the path
# `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s release-artifacts job already proves installable.

# tini: PID 1. The daemon spawns kernel workers, `bash -c` jobs and detached
#   background processes; a Python process running as PID 1 does not reap what

#   there anyway. An explicit `compileall` pass used to sit above this and was
