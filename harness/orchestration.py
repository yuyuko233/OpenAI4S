"""Replay orchestration scenarios against the real reconciler (M4-4).

The generic runner in `runner.py` models a model loop and deliberately
imports nothing from production. This one is the other kind of harness
file, and it is that kind on purpose: like the action-routing eval, it
calls a production component on recorded input, because the thing under
test — the reconciler's decision function — has no live boundary that a
fake would stand in for. Its inputs are a workload row and a backend
observation, and both are *data*.

That distinction is the whole value. A harness that re-implemented the
reconciler's rules and then checked them would be asserting a model
against a model: it would stay green through any defect the model shares
with the code, which is every defect that comes from misunderstanding the
problem rather than mistyping the solution. Driving the real `Reconciler`
means a scenario declaring `failure` is a claim about the shipped
behaviour.

The backend is scripted, the store is in memory, and the trace comes out
in the same normalized shape as every other scenario — so a golden diff
reads the same whichever runner produced it.

**A declared failure fails when the run succeeds.** That is not a detail
of the evaluator; it is why half these scenarios exist. Roughly half of
this system's job is refusing — a stale epoch, a double submission, a
cancel that must not resurrect — and a scenario that scored "no exception"
would measure nothing about any of it.
