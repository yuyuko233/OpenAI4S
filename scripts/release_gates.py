"""The canonical release quality-gate manifest, and the receipt bound to it.

One definition, imported by both sides. `run_quality_gates.py` runs what this
module lists; `release_pipeline.verify_quality_receipt` requires the receipt to
describe exactly this list. Before this module existed the producer owned a
`GATES` tuple and the consumer read nothing but exit codes, so the two could not
be compared at all:

    {"format": "openai4s-quality-receipt", "source_sha": <right sha>,
     "gates": [{"name": "pytest", "command": ["pytest"], "returncode": 0}]}

...staged a release. One gate instead of eight, `pytest` instead of
`uv run pytest -q`, and nothing to notice either. The receipt recorded a *shape*
that reads as evidence and decides nothing — the same failure the receipt was
introduced to fix, one level up. The test fixture in
`tests/test_release_pipeline.py` was itself written that way, which is how the
gap stayed invisible: the suite demonstrated the hole rather than closing it.

So verification here is exact-match, and every way a receipt can differ from the
manifest is a hard failure: a missing gate, a duplicated gate, an unknown gate, a
substituted command, a different schema version, a different manifest digest.
"Set of names is a superset" and "all recorded exit codes were zero" are both
satisfiable by a forgery.

Two kinds of gate:

`local`
    Run by the release quality job at the release SHA, in-process. The receipt
    records the exit code.
`check_suite`
    Proven by GitHub's own check runs *at that exact SHA* rather than re-executed.
    The browser matrix, Python support matrix, the real Linux private-PID
    interrupt smoke, and the independent Linux full filesystem/egress boundary
    smoke already ran on the push to `main` that the tag points at, so
    re-running them would buy nothing but latency (and, for bubblewrap, a
    different host). What makes this evidence rather than an assumption is that
    the attestation is pinned to `head_sha`: a check run for a different commit
    does not count, and the check-run and workflow-run IDs are recorded so a
    reader can go look. The interrupt smoke allows raw networking; the full
    boundary smoke refuses that override. The full smoke is attested here as
    `ci-linux-sandbox-full` and is still listed in
    `PLATFORM_CHECKS_UNAVAILABLE` until multiple scheduled runs plus a
    candidate SHA are green.

Deliberately *not* a gate: the nightly macOS/Linux sandbox jobs. They only run on
`schedule`/`workflow_dispatch`, so no check run for them exists at a release SHA
and requiring one would make every release unreachable. The release workflow runs
those checks itself, at the frozen SHA — see `PLATFORM_CHECK_COMMANDS`.
