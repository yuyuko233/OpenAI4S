"""Regenerate the Community Contributors wall in the READMEs.

Fetches the repository's contributors straight from the GitHub API (the same
source, and same commit-count order, as the sidebar / contributors graph) and
appends publicly recognized contributions that are not represented in the
commit graph. It then rewrites the block between the ``CONTRIBUTORS`` markers
in each README.

Unlike a third-party image service (e.g. contrib.rocks, which calls the GitHub
API anonymously, gets rate-limited for this repo, and rendered only a single
avatar), this runs with the repo's own token and sees every attributed
contributor.

GitHub markdown strips inline CSS, so a plain ``<img>`` is always square, and a
committed SVG that embeds the avatar as a ``data:`` URI is blocked by
raw.githubusercontent's content-security-policy.  So each avatar is cropped to a
circle with transparent corners and committed as a small PNG under
``.github/contributors/``; a round raster image renders everywhere, and each is
wrapped in a link to the person's GitHub profile.

Run by the daily local automation; runnable manually for a preview with
``GITHUB_TOKEN`` set or a ``gh auth`` session. Requires Pillow.
