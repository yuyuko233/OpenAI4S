"""What every shipped desktop bundle must contain, in one place.

Three packages now ship the same payload — the macOS ``.app``/``.dmg``, the
Linux ``.tar.gz``, and the Windows ``.zip`` that carries the Linux bundle as its
WSL2 payload — and each one has a verifier that must refuse the same failures:
a science stack that silently did not install, a source tree missing the Web UI
or the R worker, bytecode the app will rewrite in place, a developer's ``.env``
swept into the image.

Written once here rather than copied into each verifier, for the same reason
the two sandbox smokes share one implementation
(``harness/smoke/sandbox_boundary.py``): two copies drift until one platform
quietly stops checking what the other still does, and the platform that stopped
is the one that ships the broken image.

Stdlib only, and importable from a plain ``sys.path`` insert of ``scripts/`` —
these run against an unpacked release artifact, where the project is not
installed.
