# Running OpenAI4S as a lab server

[中文说明](team-server_zh.md)

This is the operator's page for the multi-user mode: what to turn on, in
what order, and what each switch actually exposes. The design decisions
behind it live in [`team-server-plan.md`](team-server-plan.md); this page
is what you do.

Everything here is **off by default**. A default install is the
single-user workbench it has always been — same routes, same behaviour,
same tests (INV-1). Nothing below happens because you upgraded.

## 1. Turn team mode on

```bash
export OPENAI4S_TEAM_MODE=1
openai4s serve
```

With team mode on, the browser path is `/login` and nothing else answers
without a session cookie. Create the first account from the machine
itself:

```bash
openai4s user add alice --role admin
```

The loopback CLI is admin-equivalent by decision D2 — whoever can read
the access-token file on the host owns the box anyway — and its actions
are audited as `cli` rather than impersonating a human account.

**The bind address is still the security boundary.** Team mode adds
accounts; it does not make the daemon safe to expose. Put it behind a
reverse proxy that terminates TLS, or reach it over SSH — see
[`security.md`](security.md). A password over plaintext HTTP on a lab
network is a password on that network.

## 2. Projects, visibility and quotas

A session belongs to whoever created it and, optionally, to a project.
`project` visibility means the project's members can read it; `private`
means the owner alone. A session with no project is private by
construction, and a session with no ownership row at all — pre-team
history, CLI runs, demo seeds — is admin-only. That last one is a
deliberate fail-closed choice: "we do not know whose this is" must not
resolve to "everyone's".

An admin reading a private session writes a `admin_read_private` row to
the audit log. That is the whole of what admin access costs, and it is
per view rather than per session.

Read access is not namespace control. For a project-visible session, every
state-changing frame operation is owner/admin-only: turns and reviews,
permission decisions, plans, annotations and Artifacts, sharing, checkpoints,
branch activation/Revert/recovery, deletion, and Notebook execution or
lifecycle control. The D4 visibility toggle is deliberately stricter: only the
owner, not an admin, decides whether their Session becomes project-readable.
The POST-shaped Revert preview remains a read. Resource-id writes and
body-addressed uploads inherit the same owner rule, so changing the URL shape
cannot turn project visibility into write access. Releasing an interactive
compute allocation is owner/admin-only. Requesting one is stricter — admin only —
because the scheduler uses the daemon's identity and site credential.
That authorization check is necessary but not sufficient: interactive
placement is also refused unless the selected backend proves a
per-allocation OS isolation boundary, as described below.
Installing packages through either the global or frame-scoped kernel route
is also admin only: both mutate a runtime environment shared by the instance,
even when the frame belongs to the caller.

Quotas are set per user or per project, per kind, per window:

```bash
curl -X PUT .../api/v1/team/quotas -d '{"scope":"user","scope_id":"...",
  "kind":"llm_output_tokens","limit_amount":2000000,"window":"month"}'
```

Only kinds with a real enforcement point may be set. A limit nobody
consults is worse than no limit, because somebody will plan around it.

## 2b. The file area

`OPENAI4S_DATA_ROOTS` is a colon-separated allowlist of directories, and D8
names three kinds of root: a **read-only datasets** area, project areas,
and **personal scratch**. The policy rides on the same value:

```bash
export OPENAI4S_DATA_ROOTS=/lab/datasets=ro:/lab/scratch
```

`=ro` makes a root read-only for everyone, admins included — the point of
a read-only root is that the reference data every analysis reads cannot
drift. A writable root gets a fixed namespace: each member uploads into
`<root>/users/<username>/`, computed from their identity and never from
the request, and another member's `users/<name>/` is not readable —
shared space stays shared; scratch is personal. That is a fixed
namespace rather than a guess, so "is this another member's area?" is a
question about a path and not about whether a directory called `alice` is
a person or a dataset.

Local Python/R Cells enforce the same ownership boundary at `open(2)`, not only
through HTTP/Host APIs. The OS sandbox hides the whole daemon data directory,
other members' writable-root `users/<name>` directories, and sibling or stale
kernel temp directories. It exposes the current workspace and private temp for
writes, and exact read-only session inputs (runtime, authorized Skill sidecars,
the owner's personal area, and a per-session verified Artifact cache). If
Seatbelt/bubblewrap cannot establish and self-test that boundary, the Cell is
refused even when `OPENAI4S_KERNEL_SANDBOX=auto`; `off` is likewise refused.
First-turn `exec_background` uses the same policy.

Do not place an `OPENAI4S_DATA_ROOTS` entry inside the canonical system temp
directory (or make either path contain the other): team mode rejects that
overlap because reopening shared data would also reopen nested private areas.
Use a persistent lab path instead. This policy isolates OpenAI4S-owned session
and personal data; it is not a general same-Unix-UID host sandbox. Ordinary
files elsewhere in the daemon account's home remain readable to a Cell. Use
separate OS identities or containers/VMs when members are mutually hostile.

## 2c. What only an admin can do

Team mode adds accounts; it does not turn every daemon-level surface into
a per-user one. Some things are done *to the instance*, and those are the
operator's regardless of who is logged in:

- writing instance configuration — the LLM provider, its endpoint and
  credential, model profiles, the default model. Rewriting `llm_base_url`
  points every user's traffic at a host of the writer's choosing;
- the legacy compute-job runner (`/compute/jobs`), which executes
  `bash -c <command>` as the daemon's own uid — reads included, since a
  job's row is somebody's command line;
- submitting a batch job to either built-in backend
  (`POST /orchestration/jobs`). `local` runs the argv as the daemon,
  outside the kernel sandbox; `cluster` invokes the scheduler with the
  daemon's Unix identity and site credential. OpenAI4S has no authenticated
  mapping from a browser member to a scheduler account, so neither backend
  may be treated as that member's own execution identity;
- requesting interactive cluster placement for a session
  (`POST /sessions/{id}/compute`), which invokes the same daemon-managed
  scheduler identity. The session owner may release an existing allocation,
  but only an admin may request one. The built-in `LocalBackend` and Slurm
  backend do not claim the additional per-allocation isolation required for
  interactive placement, so an admin request currently fails closed with
  `409 remote_isolation_required` before any session-keyed workspace,
  workload, lease, allocation, or credential is written;
- registering remote compute, installing packages into the venv every
  kernel shares (through `/kernel/install` or
  `/frames/{fid}/kernel/install`), configuring connectors that carry the
  group's credentials, publishing skills into the directory every member's
  agent loads recipes from, resetting standing permission rules, and
  creating a *global* permission rule (a member may create rules scoped to
  their own session or a project they participate in).

The same distinction applies inside a Cell. `host.skills.edit`, `publish`,
`delete`, and `rollback` are model-originated mutations of instructions or
Python sidecars that later sessions may execute, so team mode requires an
administrator even when the active overlay belongs to a project the caller has
joined. `skills_edit` also asks by default instead of inheriting the old silent
allow. This does not remove members' deliberate HTTP project controls, whose
project-membership guard remains the human authoring boundary. Member rollback
is limited to recipe-only versions with Web-authoring provenance; reactivating
a `kernel.py` version or un-attributed legacy Host history requires an admin.

Members keep every read the UI needs. The full list is
`openai4s/server/team_policy.py`, and a route not on it is a member's.

## 3. Cluster sessions (optional)

Three things have to be true before a session can run on a scheduler: the
site has to be described, the daemon has to accept workers dialling back,
and the backend has to provide verified per-allocation OS isolation. The
built-in `LocalBackend` and Slurm backend do **not** claim that isolation, so
they continue to support `BATCH` workloads but refuse interactive `SESSION`
placement. `POST /sessions/{id}/compute` returns
`409 remote_isolation_required` before it creates a session-keyed workspace,
workload, lease, allocation, or bootstrap credential.

That refusal protects a boundary file modes cannot provide. On a resource
plane where sibling allocations run as the same Unix uid, a model-authored
Cell in one allocation can read another allocation's `0600` bootstrap
credential, register first, and become that session's worker. A `0700`
directory and `0600` file exclude other Unix identities; they do not isolate
untrusted workloads sharing one identity. An extension may enable interactive
placement only when it guarantees that one allocation cannot read or modify
another allocation's workspace or unused credential—for example through a
verified per-allocation OS identity, container, or mount namespace. See the
[backend extension guide](backend-extension-guide.md#enable-interactive-remote-sessions).

**Describe the site** in `<data_dir>/cluster.toml`. Profiles are the only
vocabulary users ever see — the queue and service class each maps to stay
in this file (decision D5, INV-2):

```toml
job_name_prefix = "openai4s"

[profiles.cpu-interactive]
cpus = 8
memory_mb = 32768
walltime_s = 14400
partition = "compute"          # never leaves this file

[profiles.gpu-interactive]
cpus = 16
memory_mb = 131072
gpus = 1
walltime_s = 14400
partition = "gpu"
qos = "interactive"
```

**Accept workers** by naming an address the compute nodes can reach:

```bash
export OPENAI4S_WORKER_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8761      # where workers dial in
export OPENAI4S_WORKER_ADVERTISE=head01.lab     # what they are told to dial
```

`OPENAI4S_WORKER_LISTEN` is what turns the listener on at all. It is off
by default because a listener on every laptop that will never run a
cluster job is an attack surface, not a convenience. Set
`OPENAI4S_WORKER_ADVERTISE` whenever the bind address is not a name a
compute node can resolve — binding `0.0.0.0` is how you accept from
anywhere, and `0.0.0.0` is not a place anything can dial.

What protects that port is the bootstrap credential, not the network. A
worker presents an HMAC over `(allocation, epoch, rank, expiry, nonce)`
signed with a per-daemon secret, and the gateway verifies and burns it
**before** a single protocol byte is exchanged — this socket carries Host
RPC, so a listener that served first and checked later would be a remote
execution surface for the duration of "later". Refusals say only
"refused": the difference between expired, replayed and forged is an
oracle for somebody guessing.

The credential travels as a `0600` file and the scheduler is told only
its path (INV-9). A job's environment is readable by anyone who can ask
the scheduler about the job, so the submission environment refuses
credential-shaped variable names outright. The mode protects the credential
from other Unix users; it is not a substitute for the per-allocation boundary
above when sibling jobs share a uid.

**The channel itself is plaintext, so put this port on a trusted
network.** The credential authenticates the *worker* to the daemon, once.
It does not authenticate the daemon to the worker, and it does not
encrypt or integrity-protect anything after the handshake — and what
follows on that same socket is the kernel protocol and Host RPC: the code
being run, its output, and the results of `host.*` calls. An on-path peer
on the cluster network can therefore read those frames, and can stand in
front of the daemon for a worker that is dialling out. Run the listener on
a network where that peer does not exist, or tunnel it. Treat
`0.0.0.0:8761` as "reachable from the compute nodes", not as "safe to
expose"; server-authenticated TLS for this socket is not implemented yet.

Two bounds worth knowing about the same port: at most
`MAX_PENDING_HANDSHAKES` (64) connections may be mid-handshake at once and
the rest are closed immediately, because the thread is allocated before
the credential is checked; and the handshake deadline is a *total* one, so
a peer that dribbles bytes cannot hold a slot indefinitely.

### Leases

A cluster session holds real resources, so it has two clocks: an idle TTL
(default 2h) and a maximum lifetime (default 48h). **A worker being alive
is not a user being present** — a session whose kernel is healthy and
whose socket is connected is still idle if nobody has run anything in it,
and it is still holding what somebody else is queued for. Only a user's
execution, or an explicit renewal, renews the lease.

Which clock ran out decides what the user is told:
`SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT` means "come back and it will be here again";
`SESSION_MAX_LIFETIME_EXCEEDED` means "this one is over regardless".

### When a node dies

Recovery is `WORKSPACE_ONLY` and says so. The files survive because they
were always on the shared filesystem; the kernel's memory does not —
variables, imports, the seed somebody set three cells ago. The session
continues on a new epoch and the UI raises a `KERNEL_STATE_LOST` banner,
because results produced after a silent reconnect look exactly like
results from the session that was lost (INV-11).

`CHECKPOINT` is declared and refused with `501`. A real implementation
needs process-level snapshotting the cluster must also support, and half
of one would restore some state and quietly drop the rest — the worst of
the three possible behaviours.

## 4. Per-user LLM keys (optional)

A member can supply their own credential per provider through
`PUT /api/v1/auth/me/llm-key`. The key goes to the same secret broker as
every other credential; the database keeps a reference. Absence is the
fallback, so a member who sets nothing runs on the group's key exactly as
before.

A configured key that cannot be read **refuses the turn** rather than
falling back. The user asked for their own credential; quietly charging
the group is a decision they did not make.

## 5. Reaching it from outside the lab

The daemon binds loopback by default and that is the recommendation. Two
supported ways to reach it from elsewhere, in order of preference:

1. **SSH tunnel.** `ssh -N -L 8760:127.0.0.1:8760 you@lab-host`. Nothing
   is exposed, authentication is your existing SSH setup, and there is no
   new component to operate.
2. **Reverse proxy with TLS** on the lab network, with team mode on. The
   proxy terminates TLS and forwards to loopback. Keep `OPENAI4S_HOST` at
   `127.0.0.1`; it is the daemon's **bind address**, not an extra allowlist.
   Configure the proxy to rewrite `Host` to the exact loopback upstream,
   for example `127.0.0.1:8760`. A proxy that passes the client's `Host`
   through unchanged gets `403 host not allowed` on every request. Setting
   `OPENAI4S_HOST` to a proxy hostname can make the daemon bind beyond
   loopback and is not a supported way to admit that hostname. Name every
   external browser origin explicitly (scheme, host, and non-default port) so
   the CSRF guard can distinguish that trusted proxy mismatch from another
   site:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI4S_TRUSTED_PROXY_ORIGINS=https://lab.example
   ```

   Multiple exact origins are comma-separated. One trailing slash is
   normalized; wildcards, credentials, non-root paths, queries, and fragments
   are refused. Leaving the variable unset preserves the strict default:
   `Origin` must name the literal backend `Host`. Configuring any `https://`
   origin also makes every team login, invite-redemption, and logout cookie
   `Secure`; use that public TLS origin for browser access while the setting is
   present.

   Configuring any trusted proxy origin also disables the daemon access token's
   admin-equivalent `SERVICE_IDENTITY` on this HTTP listener. That is
   intentional: after a proxy connects to `127.0.0.1`, a public HTTPS client
   and a local CLI have the same TCP peer, and `Origin`, `Host`, or
   `X-Forwarded-*` cannot recover trustworthy process provenance. Use a normal
   admin login for management through a proxy, and do not forward the daemon
   access token. The access-token CLI path remains available when no trusted
   proxy origin is configured (direct loopback and the SSH-tunnel topology).
   Supporting it alongside public proxy ingress requires an independent local
   management transport; a forwarded-header convention is not such a boundary.

**The relay is not a third way to run a lab server.** `openai4s relay` and
`openai4s share` exist for a different purpose — a read-only, redacted
snapshot of *one* session, sent through a tunnel the daemon dials out to
([`webshare.md`](webshare.md)). The relay sees plaintext, and the share
projection is deliberately not a login surface: it carries no cookie, no
mutation routes, and no live kernel. Pointing it at a team deployment
would publish a projection of one session, not serve the workbench.

If you need the workbench itself from off-site, use option 1 or 2.

## 6. What to check after setting it up

```bash
openai4s doctor                     # configuration, credentials, kernels
curl -s localhost:8760/api/v1/auth/status
```

The daemon prints why a cluster is unavailable rather than refusing to
boot: a malformed `cluster.toml` degrades to local-only with the reason on
stderr, and so does a worker listener that cannot bind. An operator's typo
in a config file should not take the workbench down for everybody.
