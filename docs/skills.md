# Skills — capabilities as code, not schemas

A Skill is a directory under [`skills/`](../skills):

```
skills/example_stats/
    SKILL.md      recipe-centric doc (code examples, not a JSON schema)
    kernel.py     importable sidecar module (helper functions)
```

Skills are consumed by **writing code**. The loader surfaces each `SKILL.md` to the model via *progressive disclosure* (only a one-line summary up front; the full doc is fetched on demand with `host.search_skills(query)`), the kernel bootstrap finder binds each permitted Skill package to its exact discovered directory, and the agent runs e.g. `from example_stats.kernel import summary`. A Skill's capability lands as **callable Python inside the kernel** — the same principle as the core paradigm, not another tool schema.

## Bundled Skills (604)

The catalog has two maintenance tiers: 43 curated OpenAI4S Skills and a pinned,
read-only import of all 561 MIT-licensed
[GPTomics/bioSkills](../skills/bioskills/) recipes. Every imported recipe is
individually searchable and loadable, but the system prompt represents the
collection with one aggregate line rather than 561 descriptions.

A **collection** is any directory under `skills/` that holds a
`COLLECTION.json` (`id`, plus the `prompt_line` it wants in the system prompt,
where `{count}` is the number of members the caller can see) and keeps its
member Skills one level lower. The loader discovers collections from that
marker alone — no directory name, id, or retrieval policy lives in
`skills_loader/loader.py` — and every surface reads the same object:
`system_context` prints one line per collection, `list_skills` returns curated
names plus one entry per collection (pass `collection=<id>` with `offset=0`,
then follow every returned `next_offset`, to enumerate one), and the Web catalog
renders it as a single collapsed row. The bundle's
source commit, conversion rules, license, complete inventory, and per-file
hashes live at its linked boundary; importing it installs no scientific
packages and does not imply that every optional tool is ready locally.

`example_stats` is the reference example Skill (pure-stdlib descriptive-statistics helpers).

`volcengine-datapro` is intentionally limited to discovering and calling the
configured `dataPro_search` MCP tool. Discovery is not an authentication check;
only an integer `raw.structuredContent.code` of zero from a real search call is
treated as usable.

## Writing a Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with a short YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, optional `origin`, `category`, `requirements: [gpu]`) followed by a body of **runnable code examples**.
2. Optionally add a `kernel.py` with importable helper functions.
   Skill directories are loaded as pinned namespace packages: executable
   `__init__.py` files are intentionally not run. Put all executable sidecar
   initialization in `kernel.py`, whose exact bytes are hashed and captured.
3. That's it — the loader discovers it on the next run and surfaces its one-line summary to the agent. Bundled skills (`origin: openai4s`) are read-only; skills you author or import are editable from the UI (**Customize → Skills**).

GPU/model Skills (`requirements: [gpu]`) run their heavy step on a remote GPU through [`host.compute`](compute.md); everything else runs directly in the kernel.

## Three different things a Skill can give an agent

These look alike in a step card and are mechanically unrelated. Telling them
apart is what stops "the reference is unreadable" from being the wrong
diagnosis.

| | What it does | How | Where it lands |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SKILL.md loaded** | Pulls the whole recipe into the model's context | `load_skill` (native) / `host.load_skill(...)` | Model context. Step card: *Loading `<name>` skill guidance* |
| **Reference read** | Returns the bytes of ONE file inside the Skill directory | `read_skill_file` (native) / `host.skills.read(name, path)` | Model context. Step card: *Reading `<name>/<path>`* |
| **Sidecar imported** | Makes `kernel.py`'s functions callable | `import <name>.kernel` inside a Python cell | The kernel process, via the sealed import gate |

A recipe that says "read `references/data_contracts.md` before running the
pipeline" needs the second one. Until `read_skill_file` existed, the only route
was `host.skills.read(...)` from inside a Python cell — so an agent working
purely in the tool plane, and a delegated child that never runs a cell most of
all, structurally could not follow that instruction. Its natural fallback,
`read_text_file`, is confined to the session workspace and a Skill directory is
not in it, so the failure surfaced as a path error that reads exactly like "the
file does not exist".

`read_skill_file` maps to the same `skills_read` host method, so nothing about
the safety envelope changes: the Skill allowlist applies (a Skill this agent
may not see is reported as "no such skill", indistinguishable from absent, so
refusals cannot be used to enumerate), capability state applies, and the
loader's containment guard refuses any path — symlinks included — that resolves
outside the Skill directory. Output is bounded at 50,000 characters with an
explicit truncation marker, matching `load_skill`, because a data contract
silently cut mid-table is one the agent half-read while believing it had all of
it.

Only the sidecar import touches the kernel, only it needs a running worker of
the right generation, and only it is invalidated by editing `kernel.py`
mid-session.

## Writable Skill versions and rollback

Bundled `openai4s` Skills remain authoritative and read-only. Writable Skills
have two explicit distribution scopes:

- `personal` lives under `<data_dir>/user-skills` and is available to every
  project unless capability policy disables it;
- `project` lives in a project-identity-isolated overlay and is discovered only
  by a `SkillLoader` scoped to that project. A project Skill overrides a
  same-named personal Skill, but neither can shadow a bundled Skill.

`SkillVersionService` is the narrow stdlib API for installing, upgrading,
publishing, listing history, and rolling back these packages. Every operation
captures `SKILL.md`, the exact `kernel.py` bytes, and bounded resource files.
SQLite stores immutable SHA-256-addressed blobs, an immutable canonical
manifest, and append-only installation events. The active version is changed
with compare-and-swap semantics; the runtime directory is staged and verified
before replacement, and a failed pointer update restores the prior directory.
Newer versions are retained after rollback or deletion.

```python
from openai4s.skills_loader import SkillVersionService

versions = SkillVersionService()
installed = versions.install(
    "assay-qc",
    {
        "SKILL.md": "---\nname: assay-qc\norigin: personal\n---\nQC recipe\n",
        "kernel.py": "def accepted(x): return x >= 0.9\n",
    },
)
history = versions.history("assay-qc")
versions.rollback("assay-qc", installed["version_id"])
```

For project-local content, pass `scope="project", project_id="..."` to the
same methods and construct the runtime loader with the matching `project_id`.
Package ingestion rejects traversal paths, symlinks, oversized files/packages,
invalid UTF-8 documents, trusted-origin claims, and (for install/publish) a
`kernel.py` that fails the compile gate. Draft editors may retain a broken
sidecar as a versioned draft, but publishing still fails closed until it
compiles.

The same lifecycle is available through three named JSON control-tool classes:
`skill_status`, `skill_history`, and `rollback_skill_version`. Status/history
are read-only; rollback declares a runtime mutation, requires approval, is
audited by `HostDispatcher`, and can address only `personal` or the dispatcher's
current `project` scope. Python cells expose the matching
`host.skills.status(...)`, `host.skills.history(...)`, and
`host.skills.rollback(...)` methods.

Every model-authored `host.skills.edit(...)` asks for human approval by default.
This includes `SKILL.md` because its instructions enter later agent prompts, and
`kernel.py` because the compile gate proves only that the sidecar parses, not
that it is trustworthy. In team mode all Host-originated Skill mutations
(`edit`, `publish`, `delete`, and `rollback`) additionally require an
administrator. Project membership continues to authorize the authenticated
human project routes below; it does not authorize a member's model to plant a
recipe or sidecar that another project member may load. A member may roll back
to a retained, recipe-only version whose activation history proves it came
from Web Customize. A project version containing `kernel.py`, or legacy
history whose authoring boundary cannot be proven, requires an administrator
to reactivate it. The compile gate is not an authorization decision.

Customize uses narrow HTTP routes. Personal history/rollback lives at
`/api/skills/<name>/versions` and `/api/skills/<name>/rollback`; project-local
state uses `/api/projects/<project_id>/skills/<name>/versions` and
`.../rollback`. Project IDs are path-scoped and checked against the Store;
bundled Skills never expose a rollback action.

## Installing the Skill library elsewhere (`npx openai4s-skills`)

A Skill is a recipe, not an OpenAI4S API object, so the library is useful to
any agent that reads Markdown instructions. `tools/skills-installer/` is a
zero-dependency Node CLI that copies it out of this repository:

```bash
npx openai4s-skills list
npx openai4s-skills install --all                  # the 43 curated Skills
npx openai4s-skills install --collection bioskills # the 561 pinned recipes
npx openai4s-skills install alphafold2 --target claude
npx openai4s-skills installed
npx openai4s-skills uninstall --all
npx github:PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S install --all    # straight from the repo
```

**Targets.** `--target claude` → `~/.claude/skills`, `--target claude-project`
→ `./.claude/skills`, `--target openai4s` → `<data_dir>/user-skills` (honouring
`OPENAI4S_DATA_DIR`), or `--dir <path>` for anything else. Targets are
repeatable. With none given the command picks `claude` when `~/.claude` exists
and `openai4s` otherwise — detection, not preference — and prints the resolved
absolute path before writing.

**Discovery is the loader's rule, restated.** A directory is a Skill when it
holds `SKILL.md`; a directory holding `COLLECTION.json` is a collection whose
members sit one level below and are addressable by name like any other Skill.
Neither side hardcodes a directory name, so a new bundled collection is
installable the moment its marker exists.

**Source.** The npm package carries `skills/` (about 6.4 MiB packed), so the
common path needs no second download; `--remote`, `--repo`, or `--ref` fetch
the source tarball from codeload.github.com instead, cached per ref under
`~/.cache/openai4s-skills`. A download records the ref, the URL, and the
SHA-256 of the tarball it actually received — not a commit SHA, because
resolving a branch to a commit is a second request whose answer nothing checks
against the archive that was unpacked. `--ref <commit-sha>` is the
reproducible form.

**What it will not do.** It will not overwrite a Skill whose files no longer
match the SHA-256 the manifest recorded, will not remove a file it did not
write, and will not extract an archive member whose path escapes the target —
absolute paths, `..`, drive letters and NUL are rejected, and a link member
aborts the extraction rather than being skipped.

**For an OpenAI4S user this is mostly redundant.** The wheel already ships all
604 Skills and a bundled Skill takes precedence over a same-named one in
`<data_dir>/user-skills`. The command exists to put these recipes in front of
an agent that is not OpenAI4S.

Its gates are `node tools/skills-installer/selftest.mjs` (behaviour and
extraction safety), `node tools/skills-installer/check_package.mjs` (the npm
manifest still ships the CLI and the Skill tree), and
`tests/test_skills_installer_contract.py` (the assumptions the CLI makes about
`skills/` and `package.json`, asserted with no Node required).
