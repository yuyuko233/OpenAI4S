# The web app

`openai4s serve` starts a pure-stdlib scientific workbench at
`http://127.0.0.1:8760/`: `http.server`, a hand-rolled WebSocket, and the
committed Vite workbench (`openai4s/server/webui/dist/`). The source lives in
`frontend/` (Preact 10 + `@preact/signals` + TypeScript). `npm run dev` serves
`http://127.0.0.1:5173/static/dist/` and proxies `/api`, `/ws`, and `/static`
to the daemon. `npm run build` writes `dist/`; that tree lands in the same PR
as the source. `OPENAI4S_WEBUI=legacy` serves the frozen `webui/index.html` +
`app.js` hatch. Satellite pages (login, replay, share, Ketcher) stay classic
scripts.

## Available now

- **Projects and sessions** — folder/date grouping, deep links, session search,
  command palette, rename/delete, and background turns that survive a closed
  tab.
- **Live turns** — prose, semantic steps, permission pauses, plans, Cell output,
  and artifacts stream over WebSocket. Reopening an in-flight session replays
  the bounded current-turn buffer; completed history reloads over REST.
- **Versioned artifacts** — file writes become immutable versions with
  provenance, environment snapshots, lineage, annotations, priority, edit,
  rename, restore, and artifact/project ZIP download. The current viewers cover
  images, CSV/TSV tables, Markdown/text, HTML/PDF previews, and 3D molecular
  structures through vendored 3Dmol. Restore verifies a trusted immutable
  snapshot and appends a fresh version plus source→restored lineage; it never
  moves the Artifact head back onto an old row. With
  `OPENAI4S_STAGE1_TRUSTED_DELIVERY=1`, completion links name the exact
  immutable version under `/api/v1/artifacts/versions/{version_id}`. Clicking, reloading,
  and reopening therefore resolves the same checksummed bytes even after a
  newer head exists. A repeated same-checksum capture does not fabricate a new
  version; its new producing Cell and lineage remain in a separate durable
  local capture observation. The scoped lineage view projects the latest
  version's path-free producer frame, so delegated code/native outputs show the
  real child frame without fabricating a root Notebook Cell or view-code link.
- **Recoverable completion delivery (opt-in)** — Stage 1 freezes and verifies
  each linked Artifact before the final assistant message and delivery manifest
  commit together. The link-bearing WebSocket event is emitted only afterwards
  and carries a stable `delivery_id`. If that event is lost, reopening reads the
  already committed message through REST; Stage 1 records a queryable
  `committed` durable message-and-manifest fact, while `published` is the
  best-effort emit marker. The ledger does not re-emit the socket event
  automatically. The ordinary bounded WS sequence buffer may
  replay it while the turn is live; after terminal/restart, REST is
  authoritative. A failed snapshot, checksum, scope, relation, or audit check fails
  closed and publishes no success link. Capture observations are local-only in
  Stage 1; Session packages, share snapshots, and Artifact ZIPs do not yet carry
  a portable observation ledger. The UI's metadata export only mirrors the
  current local lineage response.
- **Read-only Notebook by default** — stable Cell IDs project Python/R source,
  stdout/stderr, errors, figures, files, and retry revisions. Failed older
  revisions remain collapsed and read-only; a running Cell is updated in place.
  While the model writes a Python/R fence, one transient draft block is updated
  in place and is replaced by the immutable Cell only when execution starts.
- **Explicit developer REPL** — `OPENAI4S_NOTEBOOK_REPL=1` enables multiline
  Python/R input. Shift+Enter appends a new Cell; it never edits an executed
  Cell. User Cells and Agent turns share the same per-session FIFO execution
  coordinator.
- **Exact ownership and cancellation** — runtime events expose the active
  execution owner and queue positions. Cancel/interrupt requests send the exact
  `execution_id` plus `owner.kind` and `owner.id`. The Notebook Stop control
  selects only an active or queued `user_repl` ticket and fails closed when none
  exists, so it does not fall back to interrupting the Agent. Composer/session
  cancel targets the currently displayed exact owner.
- **Action Timeline workbench surface** — the right dock has safe cards for
  native tools (including delegation calls), Python/R Cells, domain mutations,
  and finalization, plus a Recovery card with restore/retry/fresh-restart action
  availability and a Branch panel with checkpoint fork/activate/revert/undo
  controls. Branch activation is an explicit FIFO lifecycle mutation: it stops
  the old runtime, atomically publishes the selected checkpoint side-state, and
  reports `Active`, `Partial`, or `Failed` recovery instead of pretending that
  arbitrary memory survived. Context, child-agent, and Sandbox containers remain separate. Permission
  waits still use their existing interactive prompt rather than a persisted
  Timeline card. The frontend starts
  from the latest 500 actions, can explicitly load earlier 500-action pages,
  keeps at most 2,000 actions while retaining the latest state, and never renders
  raw arguments or provider wire state. Canonical token usage is shown; cost is
  shown only when the deployment supplied explicit price metadata when the
  action was recorded, otherwise it remains unknown.
- **Portable Session packages** — a session menu export produces one
  deterministic, versioned ZIP with hashes for the ledger, Notebook, branches,
  workspace CAS, Artifact versions, environment/bootstrap references, lineage,
  plans/review/memory, and non-secret policy state. Import validates the ZIP as
  untrusted input, remaps identities into a new project/root, downgrades
  permissions/capabilities, and always opens `Ended · view only` in a durable
  quarantine. Conversation, Notebook and files remain readable, while every
  live mutation returns 423 until the user explicitly confirms `Restart fresh`;
  package code, hooks and Kernel generations are never replayed. Exact-version
  completion deliveries travel with the package, but their source ids and URLs
  do not: import verifies the restored snapshots, builds local manifests/URLs,
  and atomically rebinds each local message. A missing or inconsistent
  message/ledger relation rejects the package rather than leaving a plausible
  link that cannot reopen. Stage 2 also carries a closed, sanitized Auto Mode
  audit graph. All run, candidate, audit, finding, repair, and decision
  identities are remapped per owner; the effective selection is forced to
  `off`/`user`, Verified claims become Unverified, and the original claimed
  status/terminal reason remain diagnostic provenance across repeated exports.
  Imported wall-clock timestamps record the import boundary rather than
  trusting source clocks; event cursor order preserves chronology. Raw prompts,
  hidden rationale, permission payloads, and reusable authorization never cross
  the package boundary.
- **Customize and research UX** — model profiles, Skills/Specialists,
  connectors (catalog, enable/disable, probe, and a secret-preserving launch
  configuration editor), compute, network, memory, permission rules, plan/explore modes,
  voice dictation, uploads/paste/drag-drop, annotations, and bilingual 中文/EN. The
  connector list keeps launch commands in the editor instead of mixing local
  filesystem paths into descriptions. In-tree Python connectors persist a
  portable runtime token that resolves against the current installation when
  spawned, so moving the data directory does not retain the old server's
  interpreter path.
- **Standard environment readiness (opt-in)** — with the Stage 1 flag enabled,
  persistent dashboard and conversation banners show when the `standard`
  Python/R pair is missing or cannot be verified. Customize → Compute lists all
  missing environments and packages and offers copy-only `env plan`/`env apply`
  repair commands; the browser never installs them. A normal task may still use
  native control tools or structured finalization. If it routes a Code Cell,
  that Cell is refused before a pending environment switch, identity/attempt,
  or runtime exists; the terminal event opens the Compute repair card. Direct
  Notebook Cells use the same boundary. Approved/resumed scientific plans are
  refused before their status transition until the check is ready.
- **Web sharing (off by default)** — the session menu can publish a read-only
  snapshot to `https://<share-id>.<domain>/` through a relay you run, without
  binding a public port. The recipient views the conversation/Notebook/artifacts,
  downloads a portable bundle, and imports it into their own local install to run
  or continue (quarantined until an explicit fresh restart). See
  [webshare.md](webshare.md).

## Notebook lifecycle and truthfulness

Python and R are lazy, independent persistent slots. A metadata-only or
tool-only turn does not start either kernel. The Notebook shows generation,
branch/revision placeholders, owner/queue, and states such as
`Live / Busy / Ended · view only / Restoring / Partial / Failed` when the
corresponding projections are available.

Stopping/restarting a kernel preserves messages, Cell history, workspace files,
and Artifact versions, but not arbitrary in-memory objects. A daemon restart
must not be described as namespace recovery unless the verified recovery
pipeline actually rebuilds and validates that state.

## Session-domain feature status

The Gateway now exposes the session-domain read/write adapters, while several
product affordances remain intentionally partial:

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Action Ledger and safe Timeline projection | Backend, redacted max-500 latest/older/newer REST windows, UI cards, and an explicit “load earlier actions” control are implemented. Completed recent history reloads from REST; there is no separate durable per-action WS backlog. |
| Durable approval after daemon restart | Pending cards reload directly from SQLite without starting a kernel/runtime. A live decision resumes its exact blocked call; a post-restart approval never replays stored arguments, records the old action as unexecuted, and exposes an explicit “Continue and replan” control. Restart-only `once` grants are exact and expire after 15 minutes. |
| Checkpoint / branch / revert preview | Content-addressed snapshots and public checkpoint/fork/activate/preview/apply/undo routes are implemented. Durable Cells and user messages best-effort capture exact cursor checkpoints; only records with a proven mapping advertise Fork, while old history returns 409. The UI exposes Cell Fork and collapses internal checkpoints. Activation restores workspace, Artifact heads, environment, capability/permission state and the checkpoint's full plan/review/memory snapshot, then rebuilds a branch-bound runtime. Legacy checkpoints without that sidecar report `Partial` and preserve live structured state. Revert/Undo project provider history, chat and Notebook from the same append-only cursors. |
| Recovery Journal and verified recovery pipeline | Status/actions and `restore`/`retry`/`restart_fresh` mutations are implemented for the active branch. Candidate workers publish only after bootstrap, CAS/Artifact validation, replay-safety and state validation. Bootstrap v2 captures the actual worker's complete package set, locale, interpreter prefix and SDK/provenance/Host protocol versions. Skill-load diagnostics never leak into ordinary Cell output, but they share the untrusted Cell interpreter and therefore cannot authorize durable sidecar replay; observing one marks that generation unrecoverable. Arbitrary historical namespaces without a verified recipe still end Partial. |
| Python/R `.ipynb` export | Deterministic language export/ZIP route and a stable bundle ZIP download in the Notebook header and provenance execution view are implemented. Separate Python/R single-notebook selectors remain API-only. |
| Standalone Jupyter adapter | Optional `openai4s-python` / `openai4s-r` KernelSpecs and a lazy `ipykernel` wire bridge are available outside the daemon. They use independent namespaces and do not attach to Web-session Host RPC, artifacts, ledger, queue, or recovery. |
| Scientific renderer registry | Safe catalog and version-bound descriptor routes are implemented and drive dedicated 2D chemistry, genome, sequence/MSA, and LaTeX UI components. Descriptors stay bound to immutable Artifact versions and provenance. |
| Variable Inspector | Manual Python/R namespace refresh is implemented through a dedicated idle-only protocol request. It never starts a worker, never runs a Cell, avoids custom repr/active bindings/promises, and fails closed while Busy/Restoring/Ended. Fingerprints are bounded samples, not namespace snapshots. |
| Local model discovery | Customize → Models scans a fixed literal-loopback catalogue with proxies and redirects disabled. Results are suggestions only; a user must explicitly add a profile. Unknown local model capabilities stay conservative until explicitly configured. |
| Context composition / security panels | Safe session-specific REST projections and frontend containers are implemented. Sandbox status aggregates the Python/R workers that actually started and takes the weaker claim when they differ; it remains `not_started` only until neither language has run a self-test. |
| Delegation durability and policy | A session-wide persisted tree owns the spawn budget, child progress/results, cancellation propagation, and turn-boundary steering inbox. Child model/steps/permission/capability restrictions are enforced at both native-tool catalog and Host RPC boundaries and may not widen their parent's ceiling. Daemon restart preserves the tree but truthfully marks unfinished children `stopped: daemon_restart`; it does not claim process continuation. |
| Session export/import | Deterministic hashed packages and the dashboard/session-menu UI are implemented. Packages preserve branch-owned conversation, complete canonical provider groups, Revert projection metadata, Notebook/Artifact/lineage state, evidence-review history and checkpoint plan/review/memory snapshots. Import rejects traversal, duplicate/symlink entries, tampering, compression/size/secret violations, never overwrites an existing session, never starts a Kernel, and remains durably quarantined until a confirmed fresh restart. |

The frontend deliberately treats absent routes as unavailable: controls are
disabled or show an empty state rather than mutating history or pretending a
backend action succeeded.

## Demo session (seeded on first boot)

On first boot the app seeds a NIF3/DUF34 protein-family analysis that calls the
real UniProt and RCSB PDB APIs plus a bundled MCP connector, running six
deterministic Notebook Cells without an LLM key:

1. UniProt sequence retrieval.
2. A bundled MCP connector call.
3. A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot.
4. `family_biochemistry.csv`.
5. An RCSB search and `nif3_structure.pdb` download.
6. `nif3_report.md`.

Network-unavailable steps are skipped and reported; demo data is never
fabricated.
