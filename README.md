> [!TIP]
> **Why "two cuts"?** No pricey frontier-model key needed — OpenAI4S runs on **Doubao (豆包)** via the cheapest **"Small" plan on Volcengine Ark (火山方舟)**: **¥9.9 / month (≈ US$1.4)**. Pick the `ark` provider in the UI and you get a Claude-Science-class agent for less than a cup of coffee.

## 🧬 JSON orchestration, Code-as-Action science

OpenAI4S deliberately has two action planes. Provider-native **JSON tool
calls** handle deterministic orchestration, permissions, metadata, external
services, and human approval. **Python/R Code-as-Action** handles computation,
exploration, analysis, simulation, and long-running scientific work in
persistent kernels. Python cells can synchronously call the in-kernel `host`
API while they run; R is an independent persistent analysis channel.

This is not a choice between tools and code: each does the job it is good at.
Tool-only and conversational work can finish through the Engine-owned,
strictly structured `finalize_response` action. Scientific cells keep the
important `host.submit_output(...)` completion contract, including structured
artifacts and metrics. `host.submit_output` is the only completion signal that
can fire *inside* a Cell; a later sole `finalize_response` may still close the
Engine after earlier Cells have run.

## 📣 News

- **`2026-08-24`** 🚀 **`v0.2.0` — the multi-platform release** — one release, two desktop packages: the Apple Silicon **`.dmg`** and a relocatable **Linux `x86_64` tarball** carrying the same embedded Python and science stack (the Windows/WSL2 zip is built and under stabilization — it ships in a coming release). Underneath: **Auto Mode** with a Guardian review boundary, honest **completion-evidence reconciliation** (a crashed cell can no longer render as a clean success), the **MCP Streamable HTTP** transport with the Volcengine DataPro connector and Doubao web search, **Anthropic Messages SSE streaming**, the pinned **561-recipe bioSkills collection** (603 Skills in all, installable anywhere via `npx`), a trajectory-ledger view in the workbench, Docker/Kubernetes deployment, `openai4s --version`, and the interrupt-signal train that makes a running R cell reliably stoppable on every platform.
- **`2026-08-04`** 🔭 **`main` — on the way to `v0.2.0`** — **read-only session sharing** over an outbound relay tunnel (`openai4s share` / `openai4s relay`), **seven normalized public-database connectors** that carry where a record came from and when, a versioned **`/api/v1`** surface (keyset pagination, one error envelope, a resumable WebSocket cursor), **environments as a transaction** (`openai4s env plan|apply|rollback`), a redacted `doctor` / `diagnostics` support bundle, consent-gated revocable telemetry, a retrosynthesis-planning Skill, and a **10-workflow / 20-case benchmark** that runs against the real Store, kernels, and dispatcher. Linux and Windows desktop packages were built and tested here — the Linux package ships in `v0.2.0` above, and the Windows package follows in a coming release.
- **`2026-07-15`** 🍎 **`v0.1.0` — macOS app** — a one-click, no-toolchain Apple Silicon `.dmg` with an embedded Python and the full default kernel science stack (rdkit · scanpy · the single-cell stack), plus PyPI packaging (`pip install openai4s`) and release automation. **New here? → [Startup guide](docs/startup-guide.md).**
- **`2026-07-06`** 🎉 **Open-sourced** — the pure-stdlib Code-as-Action engine, the scientific web app, 24 science Skills, and BYOC remote compute.

---

## 😮 Highlights

- **🧬 Hybrid action engine** — class-based native JSON tools orchestrate while persistent Python/R kernels execute science. CLI and Web adapters start foreground language slots lazily, so tool/finalize routing itself does not spawn one; individual tools may still manage dedicated workers.
- **📒 Ledger-first runtime** — action groups/events and terminal facts are append-only; execution attempts, generation lifecycle, usage, and completion records remain durable and reconstructable.
- **🐍 Pure-stdlib core** — the engine **and** the web server are stdlib-only (`http.server` + hand-rolled WebSocket, no framework, no deps). The LLM client speaks OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini over `urllib` alone.
- **🔌 One-line multi-provider** — `ark` (doubao · glm · kimi · deepseek · minimax) plus official `chatgpt · claude · gemini`, behind a single `host.llm`; switch from the UI.
- **🖥️ Scientific workbench** — live streaming, versioned artifacts, provenance, an Action Timeline surface, and a **read-only-by-default Notebook**. An explicit developer flag enables multiline Python/R input against the shared kernels.
- **🔐 Hardened local execution** — strict child-environment allowlists, durable approvals, one-shot generation-bound `host.bash` capabilities, and OS sandbox adapters (Seatbelt on macOS, bubblewrap on Linux) with visible degraded/fail-closed modes.
- **🔬 604 bundled Skills** — 43 curated OpenAI4S recipes for GPU/model science, research workflows, and platform operations, plus all 561 recipes from the pinned MIT-licensed GPTomics/bioSkills collection. Skills are **recipes of code**, not JSON schemas; the large third-party collection is searched on demand and occupies only one always-on prompt line. User-authored Skills stay under the data directory and cannot shadow bundled trust.
- **☁️ BYOC remote compute** — with a configured, reachable provider, dispatch GPU jobs via `ssh:<alias>` or the bundled **NVIDIA NIM** integration. General remote compute remains a Prototype surface; `host.fold` uses a strict no-fabrication policy.
- **🔗 Read-only session sharing** — publish a session as a snapshot anyone with the link can view and import, through a relay **you** run. The daemon never binds a public port; it dials out. Memories, permission state, and keys never leave, and residual secrets fail the publish closed. → [Web sharing](docs/webshare.md)
- **🔎 Source-attributed retrieval** — seven normalized public-database connectors (UniProt · RCSB PDB · Ensembl · ChEMBL · PubChem · arXiv · OpenAlex). Retrieved records carry where they came from and when, without the API key that fetched them.
- **🧰 Operable, not just runnable** — a versioned `/api/v1` (keyset pagination, one error envelope, correlation IDs, a resumable WebSocket cursor), a local credential required at startup, a redacted `doctor` / `diagnostics` support bundle, and consent-gated telemetry that is off by default and destroys its identity when revoked.

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S && cd OpenAI4S
./setup.sh     # one-time: build the environment with uv
./start.sh     # launch the web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8760/
```

`setup.sh` creates the lightweight control `.venv` with **uv**. For the comprehensive Python + R scientific kernels, install a Conda-family manager (`micromamba`, `mamba`, or `conda`) and run `./setup.sh --with-kernel-envs` instead. Existing kernel environments can be synchronized with `./setup.sh --update-kernel-envs`; updates do not prune user-installed packages. `start.sh` launches the daemon + web UI. No API key is needed to boot — **set your model in the UI** (Customize → Models). One-shot without the UI: `uv run openai4s run "Compute the mean of [4,8,15,16,23,42] and submit it." -v`.

### macOS app (no toolchain required)

Apple Silicon users can skip the checkout entirely: download `OpenAI4S-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S/releases/latest), drag it to Applications, and launch. The image embeds its own Python plus the default kernel science stack — numpy · pandas · scipy · matplotlib · scikit-learn · **rdkit** (cheminformatics) · **scanpy** and the single-cell stack · umap · numba · biopython — so the first launch needs no network and no `pip`. Data lives in `~/.openai4s`.

The build is ad-hoc signed but **not notarized**, so Gatekeeper refuses it the first time. On **macOS 15+**, open it once, then allow it under System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Open Anyway**; on **macOS 12–14**, right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**. Either way, `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OpenAI4S.app` also clears it.

**First run — point it at a model, then at search.** Launching the app opens the workbench at `http://127.0.0.1:8760/`. No key ships, so:

1. **Model API** — open **Settings ⚙ → Models**, pick a protocol (**Ark-compatible** for Doubao/GLM/Kimi/DeepSeek/MiniMax, or **OpenAI-** / **Anthropic-compatible**), paste your **API Key**, click **Add**, then **Set active**. Cheapest path: the `ark` protocol on Volcengine Ark's ¥9.9/mo plan.
2. **Search API** *(optional, recommended)* — open **Settings ⚙ → Network**, keep **Allow network access** on, and paste your Ark **Agent Plan Key** into the primary **Doubao Search Custom** card → **Save credential**. If the active Ark model already uses that key, OpenAI4S reuses it automatically. Tavily and keyless engines remain backup options; the dedicated Doubao health check never reports a fallback result as Doubao.

Full walkthrough (install → Gatekeeper → model → search → R kernel): **[Startup guide](docs/startup-guide.md)**.

The CLI ships inside the app — symlink it if you want it on your PATH:

```bash
sudo ln -sf /Applications/OpenAI4S.app/Contents/Resources/runtime/bin/openai4s /usr/local/bin/openai4s
openai4s setup        # only if you want the R kernel: needs micromamba/mamba/conda
```

The R kernel is not bundled (it needs a conda environment). On Intel Macs, install from PyPI (`pip install openai4s`) instead.

### Linux app (no toolchain required)

> [!NOTE]
> The Linux package ships with `v0.2.0` and every later release. The Windows/WSL2 package is still stabilizing and ships in a coming release — its section below describes it as it will be published; meanwhile, install inside WSL2 with `pip install openai4s` or unpack the Linux tarball there. On older releases (`v0.1.0` carried the macOS image only), use the source checkout above or `pip install openai4s`.

Download `OpenAI4S-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` from the [latest release](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S/releases/latest), unpack it anywhere, and run it. Same embedded Python and same bundled science stack as the macOS image, as a relocatable directory:

```bash
tar -xzf OpenAI4S-*-linux-x86_64.tar.gz && cd OpenAI4S-*-linux-x86_64
./OpenAI4S          # starts the daemon and opens http://127.0.0.1:8760/
./install.sh        # optional: `openai4s` on your PATH + an application-menu entry
```

`install.sh` is per-user and needs no root — it only writes into `$HOME`, and `./uninstall.sh` undoes it while leaving your data in `~/.openai4s` alone. Install `bubblewrap` (`apt install bubblewrap`) so cells run sandboxed; without it the default `OPENAI4S_KERNEL_SANDBOX=auto` reports a visibly degraded, unisolated kernel. Only `x86_64` is published — on arm64 Linux, install from PyPI (`pip install openai4s`).

### Windows (via WSL2)

Download `OpenAI4S-<version>-windows-x86_64.zip`, unzip it, and double-click `OpenAI4S.cmd`. The first run checks WSL2 and a working bubblewrap 0.8.0+ sandbox, verifies and installs the bundled Linux payload, creates `~/.local/bin/openai4s`, starts the daemon there, and opens an authenticated local URL in your Windows browser. No application download, no `pip`, no toolchain. Ubuntu 24.04 is the supported baseline; mainland PyPI/Conda mirrors and an optional WSL-reachable proxy can be configured by the launcher. See the bilingual [Windows/WSL2 guide](docs/windows-wsl.md).

**Native Windows is not supported, and the program refuses to start a kernel there** rather than warning and proceeding — it spawns POSIX subprocesses, the R channel rides file descriptors 3 and 4 through a shell redirection, and the sandbox has no Windows backend. WSL2 reports as Linux, so this package runs the same build every other platform runs. If you do not have WSL2 yet, the launcher stops and tells you the exact command (`wsl --install`, from an Administrator PowerShell). Details: **[Supported platforms](docs/platforms.md)**.

### 🐳 Docker and Kubernetes

```bash
docker compose up -d --build          # http://127.0.0.1:8760/
docker compose exec openai4s openai4s url   # the URL, token included
```

The image is built from this tree — Debian-slim CPython, the wheel, and the `science` extra — and runs as an unprivileged user with one volume at `/data`. Supply the model key as `OPENAI4S_SECRET_LLM_LLM_API_KEY` (a `Secret` in the cluster); the image reads credentials from the environment and writes nothing credential-shaped to the volume. For a cluster, `kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes.yaml` gives a single-replica Deployment, a `ReadWriteOnce` claim and a ClusterIP Service, with probes on `/health`.

An official image ships to GitHub Packages with each release — `docker pull ghcr.io/pku-yuangroup/openai4s:latest` (or a version tag, from `0.2.0`; linux/amd64) — smoke-gated by the same `container_smoke.sh` that gates every pull request, or build it from the checkout as above. Two things are worth knowing before you expose it. Binding `0.0.0.0` inside the container makes the access token mandatory and switches the DNS-rebind `Host` allowlist off, so the token becomes the only control in front of endpoints that execute code — which is why the compose file publishes to loopback and the Service is a `ClusterIP`. And an unprivileged container cannot give bubblewrap the namespaces it needs, so the kernel sandbox degrades visibly and the container becomes the boundary; that is a coarser one, and **[the container guide](docs/docker.md)** says exactly what it stops covering.

### 🧩 Take the Skills anywhere (`npx`)

The 604 bundled Skills are recipes — prose, code, and the operational knowledge to run them — and nothing about them is OpenAI4S-specific. One command copies them onto a machine, from this repository:

```bash
npx openai4s-skills install --all                  # the 43 curated Skills
npx openai4s-skills install --collection bioskills # the 561 pinned bioinformatics recipes
npx openai4s-skills install alphafold2 boltz --target claude
npx openai4s-skills list
npx openai4s-skills uninstall --all
```

`--target claude` writes to `~/.claude/skills`, `--target openai4s` to `<data_dir>/user-skills`, and `--dir <path>` anywhere you name; the resolved absolute path is printed before anything is written, and `--dry-run` writes nothing at all. Every installed file's SHA-256 goes into a manifest beside the Skills, so a reinstall refuses to overwrite a Skill you have edited and an uninstall removes only files it wrote. To run it straight from this repository with nothing published in between: `npx github:PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S install --all`.

If you already run OpenAI4S, you already have all 604 — a bundled Skill takes precedence over a same-named one in your data directory. The command exists for the other direction.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Delivered

- [x] Ship the next-generation workbench foundation: branch activation and
  append-only Revert/Undo projections, verified recovery with explicit
  Partial/Failed state, dependency-level stale propagation, durable delegation,
  quarantined portable Session packages, checkpointed plan/review/memory state,
  and dedicated 2D chemistry/genome/sequence/MSA/LaTeX renderers. Arbitrary
  in-memory namespace objects are deliberately not serialized; recovery remains
  Partial unless a safe recipe can rebuild and verify them, and Fork is offered
  only on records that carry a proven checkpoint mapping, so older history
  returns 409.
- [x] Read-only session sharing over an outbound relay you operate, with the
  daemon never binding a public port and residual secrets failing the publish
  closed.
- [x] An **executable** benchmark of end-to-end scientific workflows — 11
  workflows / 34 cases run against the real Store, kernel managers, host
  dispatcher, and compute manager, where a declared `failure` /
  `permission_denied` / `recovered` / `provenance` outcome fails when the run
  *succeeds*. Publishing comparable public results is still ahead.
- [x] Environments as a transaction (`openai4s env plan|apply|rollback`): a
  generation is built fresh, verified, and only then pointed at atomically, so
  an artifact's provenance can name an immutable one.

### Next

- [ ] **Publish the Windows and Linux desktop packages** next to the macOS image, so every supported platform installs without a toolchain.
- [ ] **NVIDIA scientific computing suites** — bring **BioNeMo** (biomolecular foundation models) and **Parabricks** (GPU-accelerated genomics pipelines) in as first-class Skills and BYOC backends, beyond today's NVIDIA NIM integration.
- [ ] Local GPU model serving so structure/design Skills run without remote compute.
- [ ] More BYOC providers (Modal / SLURM) beyond SSH + NVIDIA NIM.
- [ ] Stronger Linux isolation beyond bubblewrap where available (for example seccomp), and wider packaged sandbox smoke coverage.
- [ ] Keyless `web_search` beyond DuckDuckGo (rate-limit resilience).

## 💡 Contributing

OpenAI4S is a community effort to keep the **Code-as-Action** paradigm open.

Before opening a PR, please read [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) — it defines branch naming, the PR checklist ([`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md)), code ownership ([`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS)), review & release policy, and the offline-test policy.

### Development setup

Requires **Python ≥ 3.10** and [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S && cd OpenAI4S
./setup.sh                          # uv sync --locked --extra science + pre-commit hook
./setup.sh --with-kernel-envs       # optional: full Python + R kernel stacks
uv run pytest                       # offline test suite (LLM mocked)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files   # format + lint everything
```

Style is enforced by **pre-commit** — `black`, `isort` (`--profile black`), and `ruff`, pinned in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml). Runtime deps: the core is **zero-dependency** (pure stdlib); the optional `science` extra pins `numpy>=1.24 · pandas>=2.0 · matplotlib>=3.7`.

### What we welcome

- **New Skills** — a `SKILL.md` (+ optional `kernel.py`) under `skills/` — recipes of code, not schemas.
- **New providers** — a wire adapter under [`openai4s/llm/providers/`](openai4s/llm/providers/) plus its provider definition and registry entry, or a BYOC compute provider.
- **Engine & UI** — the core is pure stdlib and readable; the web app is framework-free.

Keep the core dependency-free, guard optional science imports behind `try/except ImportError`, and make sure `uv run pytest` and `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` pass before opening a PR.
