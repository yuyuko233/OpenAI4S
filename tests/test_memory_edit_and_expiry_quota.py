"""Two halves of retention that disagreed, and the operation that was missing.

**Expiry withheld a memory and kept its slot.** `RETENTION_DAYS` stops injecting
a memory nobody has touched in a year, deliberately without deleting it -- an
undoable delete on a schedule the user never saw would be worse. But admission
counted every row in the scope, so two hundred expired memories filled the quota
with entries that are never injected and never will be, and every new write was
refused with "delete one first" about memories the pane already lists as
omitted. Withholding has to release the slot too, or the rule means one thing
when reading and another when writing.

**A memory could be written and deleted, never corrected.** Fixing a typo in
standing context meant delete-and-rewrite: two round trips through a scope that
may be at its cap, so the second can fail and leave the user with neither
version, and the row loses its place in the newest-first order that both the
pane and the injection use. And because retention keys off the last touch, an
edit that did not record one left the correction expiring on the original's
clock.
