"""The quality receipt must describe the canonical gate manifest, exactly.

Every test here drives the **production** consumer —
`release_pipeline.verify_quality_receipt`, or the `step_test` that staging
actually calls — rather than the manifest helpers in isolation. That distinction
is the reason this file exists: the old consumer read `format`, `source_sha` and
a list of exit codes, so a receipt claiming one gate named `pytest` with the argv
`["pytest"]` staged a release. `tests/test_release_pipeline.py::_write_receipt`
wrote exactly that document and every test passed, which is how a receipt that
proved nothing looked like a receipt that proved something.

Each case below is one mutation of a good receipt. A mutation the consumer
accepts is a forgery the pipeline accepts.
