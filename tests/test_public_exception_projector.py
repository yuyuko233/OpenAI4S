"""One canary exception, raised on every public surface, must never come back.

`errors.public_failure` is an *envelope*: it decorates a body that already has
an `error` key and deliberately never rewrites it, because those messages are
author-written and are the product. That left the case it cannot handle by
itself -- an `except Exception` that put `str(e)` straight into the body. The
envelope then bolted `code`, `status` and `request_id` onto the raw exception
text, which made the leak look like a designed response.

What actually leaks through `str(e)`: a `PermissionError` names an absolute
path (and with it the account's username), an `OSError` from a spawn quotes the
argv it tried to run, and a provider/MCP error routinely echoes the credential
or the header it was sent. So this file raises ONE exception carrying all three
shapes on each surface -- HTTP dispatcher, WebSocket chunk, async job result,
plan job, REPL job, connector call, remote compute, and the operator diagnostic
-- and asserts the same three things every time: none of the three canaries is
in the public body, the body carries a stable `code`, and it carries a request
id that is this daemon's own.

Every case drives the real production callable. Nothing here re-implements the
projection: a copy of `public_exception` in this file would pass with
`public_exception` deleted, which is the exact failure `errors.py` documents
for `gateway_error_payload`.
