"""Versioned, transactional schema migrations.

The database carried no version marker at all. Every open re-probed every table
with PRAGMA table_info and ALTERed in whatever was missing, each ALTER wrapped
in a bare `except sqlite3.OperationalError: pass`. So:

  * "is this database current?" was not a question the code could answer;
  * a genuinely failed ALTER was indistinguishable from the benign "duplicate
    column name" of a re-run, and the process carried on against a schema
    missing a column it believed it had; and
  * the set was not atomic — the ALTERs ran outside any transaction, so an
    upgrade that failed part-way left a partially-migrated schema with nothing
    to detect it by.

The invariant these tests pin: a database is either fully at version N or still
fully at version N-1. Never in between.

The retrofit rests on one property, asserted below: the legacy pass is
idempotent *by predicate* (it adds only absent columns; every backfill is
guarded by a WHERE selecting only rows that still need it). That is what makes
it safe to define version 1 as "the legacy baseline has run" and stamp it,
without reconstructing which ALTERs an existing install had already applied —
history that is simply not recorded anywhere.
