    Not removed for being red. #57 had made it pass, moving suppression off
    `<commit>:<file>:<rule>:<line>` fingerprints -- which squash-only merging
    duplicates out from under you -- and onto anchored `regexTarget = "secret"`
    values that survive a rewrite. That fix worked.

    It was removed because of the cost that fix could not touch. A generic
    entropy rule over *all history* fires on synthetic fixtures, and a fixture
    that has to look real in order to be found by the code under test is
    exactly the kind this repository keeps needing. Each one becomes another
    allowlist row a reviewer must argue for, and the list only grows: #57
    curated two values, then #63 added a third within the day -- for a string
    that the working tree already suppressed inline, because an inline comment
    cannot cover the commit that introduced the line before the comment
    existed. Every such suppression is correct and none of them is free.

    `scripts/source_secret_scan.py` keeps the property that mattered: named
    provider detectors (AWS, GitHub, OpenAI, Google, Slack, Stripe, private
    keys) instead of an entropy heuristic, so a placeholder in a fixture is not
    a finding while a real key pasted into that same file still is -- with no
    list to curate. It reads the working tree, which is where a leak has to be
    fixed regardless of which commit introduced it. CodeQL is untouched.

    What is given up, stated plainly rather than left implicit: a credential
    that was committed and later removed is no longer detected. If that matters
    again, run gitleaks over history once by hand -- do not reinstate a
    scheduled job with an allowlist to feed.
