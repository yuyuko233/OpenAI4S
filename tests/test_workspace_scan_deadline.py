"""The walk was bounded in entries, which is not the same as being bounded.

`MAX_SCAN_ENTRIES` caps how many directory entries a scan visits, and its own
comment names the reason: "the walk is unbounded work, not just unbounded
memory". It then bounds the work in syscalls. How long those syscalls take is a
property of the filesystem, not of this process — on a network mount, or over
entries whose inodes are cold, a scan well under a hundred thousand entries
outlives any timeout the caller set, and the caller cannot intervene because
the whole walk happens inside one tool call.

So the three walkers now carry a wall-clock budget as well, reported through
the same `scan_truncated` flag the entry cap uses: a partial answer must never
look exhaustive, whichever budget ran out.

Fault-injected by making the *filesystem* slow rather than by lowering the
budget — a test that shrank `MAX_SCAN_SECONDS` to zero would pass against a
walker that checked the clock once and never again.
