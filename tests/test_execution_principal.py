"""`host.frames` must not read a colleague's cells (external review #2).

The team-mode scoping lived in the SQLite authorizer, which only
`host.query` goes through. `host.frames` reads the same rows -- frame
names, cell code, stdout -- through ordinary Store methods, so a member's
agent could browse every session, regex-search every cell, and open any
colleague's frame by id. A guard on one of two doors into the same data.

What is asserted here is the *principal*, not a parameter. The fix is not
"pass visible_to_user_id" -- that is the same defect with more call sites,
because the argument's absence reads as unscoped rather than as refused.
So the tests below check the three properties that make it a boundary:
absent is refused, `None` is never an operator, and the filtering happens
before the bytes are read.
