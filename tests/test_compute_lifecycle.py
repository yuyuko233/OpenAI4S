"""A remote job's fate is a claim, and every claim here needs evidence.

Four false claims this file pins down, each of which the manager used to make
without anything to back it:

  * **"the provider refused"** — the helper died before writing a reply, which
    says nothing at all about whether the remote op landed. It was classified
    `transient`, read as an explicit rejection, and persisted as terminal
    `failed`. Reconcile skips terminal rows, so a job the provider had already
    accepted became invisible while it kept running and kept billing.
  * **"it is cancelled"** — `close()` wrote `cancelled` over every live job
    without signalling an ssh job at all, and after a restart without even
    attempting the byoc terminate, because the sandbox map is in-memory.
  * **"this is its terminal state"** — two threads could both read `running`,
    both pass the transition check, and then overwrite each other, so a
    `cancelled` could land on top of a `succeeded`.
  * **"it timed out"** — inferred from exit code 124, which a command is free
    to return with no deadline armed at all.

The last one is proved against a real shell in
``test_compute_trust_boundary.py``, where the harness lives.
