"""Every route the router can match must have a checkable response contract.

Not "a schema for every route" — several routes legitimately answer with a
stream, a redirect, a file, or nothing at all, and inventing a JSON schema for
those would be a fabrication dressed as coverage. What each route must have is
an *observed* contract: the kind of thing it returns, the statuses it returns
it with, and — for JSON — a shape frozen in `docs/response-schemas.json`.

Two rules keep the number honest:

* **Derived, never declared.** The kind comes from what the handler actually
  sent: the status code and the content type on the way out. A hand-maintained
  list of "these routes stream" drifts the moment a route changes, and drifts
  silently.
* **An error is a contract.** A route driven with no parameters answers 400 or
  404 from the real handler, and that response is as much a promise as the
  happy path. It is *not* a way to tick a box: the assertions below require the
  status to be a real HTTP status and the body, when JSON, to have a shape.

An empty schema or `additionalProperties: true` would satisfy a coverage count
while promising nothing, so both are rejected outright.
