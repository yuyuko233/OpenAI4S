"""Contracts that had frozen only a refusal.

Two halves of one defect. A route whose sole observed response is an error has
a published contract describing nothing a client depends on — and it does not
read as a gap, because an error *is* a contract and the coverage gate counts
it.

* Three routes answer a successful request with **bytes**: the notebook export,
  the Session package, and an artifact download. The parameterless sweep that
  produces both frozen artifacts has no session and no artifact to ask for, so
  each of them 404'd. Worse than uncovered: the four unimplemented verbs still
  supplied the dispatcher's 404, so `docs/response-contract.json` published a
  download endpoint as `kinds: ["json"], statuses: [404]` while the status, the
  content type, and the very fact that it is a download went unrecorded.

* `PATCH|POST|PUT /annotations/<id>` on an unknown id answered 404 with
  `{"annotation": null}` — the one refusal on this surface outside the
  PublicFailure envelope. No `error`, no stable `code`, no `request_id`, so
  `app.js`'s `api()`, which turns every non-2xx into an ApiError built from
  `j.error`, reported a failure that said nothing at all. That body was frozen
  into `docs/response-schemas.json` as the route's error contract.

* The same shape, at scale, across the session surface. Most of this server's
  routes are frame-scoped, and the sweep probes them with an id shaped like a
  real one that names nothing -- so thirty of them published 404 as their whole
  contract. A client generating against the artifact had no shape for the
  Timeline, the execution queue, the branch list or the recovery journal. The
  seeded pass now drives them against resources that exist, and the gate below
  fails if any of them goes back to describing only its refusal.

Every status asserted below goes through `_route`, never a directly called
route method: a `GatewayError` raised out of a method call has already been
observed reaching HTTP as a 200 elsewhere in this server.
