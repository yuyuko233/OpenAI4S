"""Whether a user can find out that their model configuration is wrong.

`ModelProfileService` draws a careful line. `readiness` answers "is this
configured" from local state alone, so opening Customize costs nothing and
cannot spend anyone's API quota; `probe` contacts the endpoint once, because a
human pressed something. Both are implemented, tested, and served — `readiness`
rides on every profile in `GET /model-profiles`, and `POST
/model-profiles/{id}/probe` is routed.

Neither had a call site. The Models tab derived its own status from
`has_api_key` — a binary that carries no reason and cannot express
`unsupported`, the state of a profile naming a protocol this build does not
dispatch (an imported config, or one carried over from a build that offered a
provider this one dropped). Such a profile has a key, so the row showed it as
configured and it failed only when a turn used it.

Scope, stated honestly: `needs_model` is unreachable for the five protocols
Customize offers, because every one of them has a default model. It is checked
here anyway since the branch exists and a future protocol without a default
would land on it.

The larger half is the probe. Nothing could reach it, so the answer to "is my
endpoint actually reachable" was to send a message and find out.

The probe stays a button. A readiness card that probed on render is exactly the
implicit outbound call the service's own docstring refuses, and the route is
POST so a prefetch cannot spend the user's quota for them.
