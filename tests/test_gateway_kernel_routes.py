"""The kernel routes, pinned before they are moved.

`Handler._api` is one method of ~2,100 lines and the agreed direction is to
carve route groups out of it. The kernel group is the first slice, and an audit
of what would catch a mistake found that it is largely unwatched:

  * `GET /frames/{id}/execution`, `/kernel`, `/status` and `/environments` had
    no frozen response shape and no route-level test at all. The one test that
    mentions `/execution` asserts a 404 raised by an *upstream* guard, so it
    passes with the handler deleted outright.
  * `kernel/restart`, `/stop`, `/start` and `/env` had a frozen shape for the
    403 "REPL disabled" envelope only. The guard was pinned; what the route
    actually does was not. Swapping the restart and stop bodies during the move
    would have passed pytest, passed the response-shape gate, and passed the
    browser smoke run (restart and start have no call site in either).

So these are not tests of the extraction. They are the tests that make the
extraction checkable, and they belong before it rather than after, when they
would be written to match whatever the moved code happens to do.

Two behaviours here look like bugs and are deliberately pinned as they are.
Ten of the twelve routes answer 200 for a frame id that does not exist, and
`kernel/install` is deliberately *not* gated by `notebook_repl` while its six
siblings are. Changing either is a behaviour change; this file's job is to
notice if the move makes one by accident.
