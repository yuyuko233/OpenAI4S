"""Revocation is a boundary, not a request to stop soon.

Two defects, both invisible to a functional test and both about *when*:

  * ``sender.send`` read consent, and then — on another thread, at another
    moment — opened a socket. A revoke landing in that window returned to the
    caller while a payload sealed under the destroyed identity was still on its
    way to the opener. "With no consent, not a single packet leaves the
    machine" was true only if nobody was mid-send when consent went away.
  * ``emit`` started a fresh daemon thread per flush. ``_MAX_BUFFER`` bounded
    the *records* and nothing bounded the threads, sockets or payloads in
    flight, so a stalled collector turned an event rate into a thread rate.

The first test forces the interleaving with a barrier rather than hoping for
it; the second holds a collector open and counts what the daemon actually
spends on it.
