"""An `@file` reference is a record, not a token the backend re-parses forever.

The reference used to exist only as `@name#v-id` inside the message text. Two
things followed from that, and both were reproducible before this module:

1. **The same sibling-session file could be referenced exactly once.**
   Materialisation refuses when the live filename is already taken, and after
   the first successful reference *it* is what took it. The second turn naming
   the same file came back `materialise_failed` and the model received nothing
   -- for a reference that had worked one turn earlier.
2. **Two artifacts sharing a name were mutually exclusive.** Referencing a
   sibling's `shared.csv` while this session had its own hit the same refusal,
   so the pinned form -- whose entire purpose is that a name is not an identity
   -- could not actually deliver the version it named.

And nothing durable said what the model read: after a cross-session copy the
text names the *source* version while the bytes came from the local one, so
reopen, branch and export could only re-parse a string into the wrong answer.
