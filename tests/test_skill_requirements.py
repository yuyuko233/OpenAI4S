"""What a Skill needs before it can run, and whether this machine has it.

Fourteen bundled Skills have declared `requirements: [gpu]` in their frontmatter
since they were written, and nothing read it — not the loader, not the Skill
object, not the catalogue row. So a GPU-only Skill looked exactly like one that
runs anywhere, and the agent found out the difference at execution time, deep
into a task, after the user had already waited.

Readiness is answered from local state alone. Browsing a catalogue is not a
request to contact anything, and the report says so: `浏览不联网`.
