"""Monotonic sequence numbers and the WebSocket resume cursor.

A turn keeps running server-side after every client disconnects, so a browser
that drops mid-turn has to catch up when it comes back. The hub already kept a
capped replay buffer, but replay was all-or-nothing: a reconnecting client
received the whole turn again and had no way to tell which of those events it
had already rendered. Duplicated deltas are not a cosmetic problem — the stream
is append-only text, so a re-delivered chunk is indistinguishable from new
output.

Contract v1 (proposal §4.6) asks for a monotonic sequence and a resume cursor.
Each event now carries `seq`; a client passes the highest one it actually
applied as `since_seq` and gets only what came after.

The buffer is capped, so a client away longer than the window cannot be served
by a cursor at all. That case is reported (`gap: true`) rather than papered
over, because silently starting mid-stream would leave a hole the client cannot
see.
