"""A bundled Skill must not tell the agent to call something that isn't there.

Two phantom APIs turned up in one day, and both had the same shape: a name the
recipes used confidently, that no module defined and no test exercised, sitting
at the point where the agent publishes its results.

  * ``save_artifacts(...)`` — the real facade is singular,
    ``host.save_artifact(path)``. Ten Skills ended their remote-compute recipe
    with the plural form, so an agent did the GPU work and then died with
    ``NameError`` before saving anything.
  * ``wait_for_notification`` — a "brain-tool" no registry ever contained, that
    the same recipes told the agent to park on.

Neither was catchable by the existing tests: SKILL.md prose is not imported,
and the code blocks are executed only by a live agent against a real provider.
This gate reads the recipes the way the kernel would.

The rule is deliberately narrow, so that it stays true rather than becoming a
thing people mute:

  * only **bare calls** count. ``pd.read_csv(...)`` is an attribute on a name
    that must itself resolve, and is checked that way; a method on a runtime
    object is not something this file can know about.
  * a name counts as resolvable if it is a Python builtin, is bound anywhere
    in the skill's own code blocks (assignment, import, ``def``, loop target,
    ``with ... as``, ``except ... as``), comes from the skill's ``kernel.py``
    sidecar, or is one of the two names the kernel actually injects.
