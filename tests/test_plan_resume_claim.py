"""Resuming a paused plan is a claim, and two callers cannot both win it.

Driven over real HTTP against a real ``ThreadingHTTPServer``, because the whole
defect lives in the gap between "the route decided" and "the job wrote": a
direct call to ``PlanService.resume_execution`` serialises itself and shows
nothing, and asserting on status codes alone would not notice two jobs running
the same steps. So the turn is counted, not inferred.
