"""The HTTP surface has to have a shape someone can check against.

The Contract scorecard asks for the external surface to be covered by schema.
The obvious way in -- generate it from the routing code -- has a prerequisite
nobody had paid: ``Handler._api`` is one method of ~2000 lines and ~150
branches with response bodies assembled inline, so nothing can be read off it
until it is decomposed. The clause stayed unmet not because it was hard to
agree with but because it was gated behind a refactor.

So the dependency is inverted. Every route already produces real responses
while the suite runs; those are generalised into shapes and frozen. Two
properties follow that a hand-written schema does not have:

  * it cannot describe a response the code does not produce, because it was
    derived from responses the code produced;
  * coverage is a measured number rather than an assertion. 50 of 143 routes
    are pinned today. The remaining 93 are ones no offline test reaches, which
    is a gap in the *tests*, and naming it is the first step to closing it.

What this file checks is that the frozen artifact stays honest: that it
describes real routes, that the shape algebra it is built on is right, and --
the part that earns its keep -- that a change which would break a client is
distinguishable from one that would not.

    `_route` assigns a correlation id -- an inbound `X-Request-Id`, else

    carries a null one. But most gateway tests build a handler with
    `object.__new__` and never set the attribute, and the first capture that
    saw enriched bodies froze `request_id` as `["null", "string"]` on 17 routes
    and `"null"` on one.

    That is a property of the harness published as a property of the API, which
    is worse than an absent one because a client believes it and writes
    null-handling that can never run. The capture substitutes a fixed synthetic
    id for a handler that has none; this asserts the substitution is still in
    place, because losing it is silent.

    Scoped to `[error]`, because that is where the envelope exists:
    `public_failure` enriches failures only, so `request_id` in an `[ok]` shape
    is a *resource* field that happens to share the name. The admission
    ledger's is one -- `reserve_with_admission` takes no request id, so a row
    really is NULL between the reservation and the later stamp, and demanding
    a string there would make the contract describe a state the server does
    not have. The narrowing costs nothing measurable: 607 of the 611 frozen
    shapes carrying `request_id` are `[error]`, and all four `[ok]` ones are
