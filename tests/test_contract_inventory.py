"""The documented contract must cover the surface the code actually serves.

The proposal requires that every external route and event be covered by a
contract inventory. The load-bearing word is *checkable*: a list maintained by
hand is wrong the first time somebody adds a route in a hurry, and its being
wrong is invisible, which is precisely the failure a contract exists to
prevent. So the inventory is derived from the code and compared against the
document — by parsing the routing chain out of the source, and, for a module
that has migrated to declarative `RouteSpec` objects, by reading its live
`ROUTES` table as well. Both readings run over every route module; neither
replaces the other.

This found two real gaps on its first run — `branch_projection_restored` and
`branch_activation_state` were emitted to clients and handled by the frontend
but appeared nowhere in `docs/webapp-api.md`. That is the drift this test
exists to stop.

Scope, stated plainly: this answers "which paths and events exist", not "what
shape do they return". Response shapes are the next layer and live in
`docs/response-schemas.json`, captured from real responses.

The inventory now scans the route modules being carved out of `Handler._api`
as well as gateway.py. Reading gateway.py alone made the decomposition
self-defeating: moving the kernel group dropped 12 routes out of the inventory
and orphaned 11 frozen response shapes, and the obvious repair -- regenerate
the artifact until it is green -- re-files those shapes under the catch-all
`/frames/([^/]+)(?:/.*)?` and destroys the per-route contract.

A migrated module is scanned *and* read, for the same reason. Trusting its
`ROUTES` table instead of its source reopened the identical hole one level
down: a leftover `re.fullmatch` branch beside the declarations, or a table
named anything but `ROUTES`, silently left the inventory.
