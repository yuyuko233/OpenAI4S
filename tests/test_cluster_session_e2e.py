"""The whole chain, offline: fake scheduler, real worker, real socket (M3b-7).

The fake `sbatch` here does what a real one does — it runs the submitted
script on a node — except the node is this machine. Everything above it is
the production path: the real `SlurmBroker` shelling out, the real
`SlurmBackend`, the real `Reconciler`, the real `Store`, the real
`WorkerGateway`, the real credential, the real `worker.py` in its own
process, and the real frame protocol over a real TCP socket.

That arrangement is the point. A test that stubbed the launch would be
asserting that the code does what it was written to do; the questions
worth asking here are the ones only a real subprocess can answer — does
the credential the daemon wrote actually admit the worker it was written
for, does a variable set in one turn still exist in the next, does an
interrupt reach a process the daemon has no pid for, and does a lease
expiring actually take the resource back.

The plan's M3b-7 scenario list, in order: variables surviving across
turns, interrupt, cancel, lease expiry, an expired credential, and a
stale epoch.
