"""The DNS-rebinding Host allowlist (GHSA-fm3g-2c7x-8qj8), over a real socket.

`tests/test_gateway.py::test_dns_rebinding_host_header_is_rejected` already
covers the guard, but it does so on a synthetic handler: `object.__new__` plus a
monkeypatched `_json`/`_api`. That proves `_route` *decided* 403 — it cannot
prove a 403 is what a client receives, because nothing in it ever writes a
status line. This project has been bitten by exactly that gap before (a
`GatewayError` asserted from a direct method call still reached HTTP as 200), and
the guard being audited here is the one control standing between a rebound
browser tab and `/api/v1/compute/jobs`. So this module binds the real
`make_handler` output into a real `ThreadingHTTPServer` and speaks raw HTTP/1.1
at it, asserting the status line on the wire.

It also pins three properties the synthetic test cannot express at all:

* the guard runs **before** the token gate — a forged Host with no credential
  must be refused as a Host, not as a 401, or the ordering claim in `_route` is
  decorative;
* it covers surfaces outside `/api/` — the SPA shell, `/static/`, and the
  token-exempt `/health` — because a rebound page is same-origin and can read
  every one of those response bodies;
* the `/api/v1/ws` upgrade is refused with a status line rather than switching
  protocols, which is the difference between "rejected" and "attacker now holds
  a socket that accepts commands".

Remove the `_host_header_allowed()` call from `_route` and the forged-Host cases
here answer 200 (and 101 for the WebSocket) instead of 403.
