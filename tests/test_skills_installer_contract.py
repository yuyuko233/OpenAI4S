"""The assumptions the npm-side Skill installer makes about this repository.

`tools/skills-installer/` is JavaScript, and its own behaviour is gated by
`node tools/skills-installer/selftest.mjs`. What that self-test cannot own is
the *other* half of the contract: the shape of `skills/` and the packaging
manifest that decides what a published package contains. Both live on this side
of the language boundary and both drift silently — a Skill added without
`SKILL.md`, a `bin` path renamed, a `files` glob that stops matching — so they
are asserted here, in the suite that runs on every commit with nothing but
Python installed.

Deliberately NOT here: anything that would require Node. A test that shells out
to `node` reports success by skipping on the machine that does not have it,
which is the failure mode the marker policy exists to prevent.
