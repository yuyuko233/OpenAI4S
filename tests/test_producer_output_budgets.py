"""Producer-side byte budgets for everything a cell can emit.

Three of the worker's output paths were bounded only when the response frame
was assembled: kernel stderr, the formatted traceback, and — on the R side —
the error string. `_cap` produced exactly the right string and exactly the
wrong allocation, because by the time it ran the whole payload was already in
worker RAM.

Measured on the tree before the fix, with the same code these tests drive:

  * a cell doing 200 x `sys.stderr.write('x' * 1_000_000)` peaked at **452 MB**
    of traced allocation to retain 1 MB of it;
  * formatting a sixty-deep exception chain whose links share one 1 MB message
    peaked at **122 MB** to produce 61 MB of text that was then cut to 1 MB.

Both returned the correct, capped string. That is why nothing caught this, and
it is why every assertion below is about ALLOCATION rather than about the
returned length: `tracemalloc` peak is the observable, and it does not depend
on timing, machine speed, or when a thread happens to be scheduled.

    R is single threaded, `addTaskCallback` does not fire inside an expression

    is one expression printing 300 MB wrote all 300 MB to a tempfile -- a tmpfs

    The test above builds its own reader off `.buffer` and proves the byte
    budget works there. Reverting `_spawn` to read the decoded `proc.stderr`
    left it green -- it verifies the mechanism and not the wiring, which is the
    gap this codebase keeps shipping.

    Asserted on the compiled code rather than the source text: an earlier draft
    matched a source string and broke on a variable rename, and spawning a real
    kernel here hangs the suite.

    The target moved from `Kernel._spawn` to `PipeTransport` when the kernel
    grew a second transport (M3b-1). The claim did not move: this is still
    about the production wiring for a local child, which is where every drain
    the product actually runs comes from.
