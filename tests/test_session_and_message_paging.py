"""Reaching the part of a project, and of a conversation, that is off the page.

Three separate states hid behind one heading, and only two of them were broken
in the same place:

  * The **session list** cursor was real on the server and had no caller. The
    route has answered with `next_cursor`/`has_more` since it was written and
    no line in `app.js` read either field, so the sidebar stopped at the newest
    100 sessions and offered nothing to press. This file proves the walk the
    client now performs: 260 sessions, every one of them, none twice, and a
    session arriving mid-walk that does not disturb the cursor.

  * The **message** page was newest-first on the server, with `next_before_seq`
    and `has_earlier` beside it, and again no caller — so in a 640-message
    session the older 340 were paged for and unreachable.

  * The **export** was reported as already carrying every branch. It does, and
    it is exercised here rather than read: the whole archive, from a live
    route, first message and last, both branches.

The one server defect the walk exposed is the message route's page size. A
`?limit=banana` raised `ValueError` out of the route and reached the browser as
a 500 `internal_error`, while `before_seq=banana` on the *same route* answered
400 — and `?limit=-5` answered 200 with an empty page and `has_earlier: false`,
which a paging client reads as the start of history. Both are asserted below
through the real handler, because a `GatewayError` raised from a method call
says nothing about the status the browser receives.
