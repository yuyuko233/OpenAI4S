"""A real worker, over a real socket, driven by the real Kernel (M3b-1/2).

The worker is started as an actual subprocess with no inherited protocol
pipes; it dials the gateway, presents a credential, and then runs cells
through the same `Kernel.execute` the local path uses. That is the only
arrangement that proves the claim: a `StringIO` or a fake socket would
exercise the parts that were never in doubt.

Everything the plan pins is asserted here rather than assumed: the
credential is single-use, an old epoch is refused (INV-7), a forged or
expired one is refused, nothing secret rides the environment (INV-9), and
the frame protocol behaves identically to the pipe path — including the
mid-cell `host_call` round trip, which is the whole reason this transport
has to preserve the host-call transaction discipline.

    The fence is not a cache. It is the record of which credentials have

    recovery had closed. `_save_state` publishes through `os.replace`, so an

    not parse is disk damage or somebody editing it, and the second is
    precisely the party this fence refuses.
