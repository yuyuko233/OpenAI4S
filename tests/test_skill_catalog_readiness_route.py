"""What the Web Skills catalogue tells a user about whether a Skill can run.

The loader has parsed `requirements:` and computed ready/needs_setup/unknown
for a while, and the *host* surface reads it. The Web projection in
`server/skills.py` dropped both fields, so the route never carried them and the
Customize list could not render them: a GPU-only Skill (sixteen of the bundled
ones declare `requirements: [gpu]`) looked exactly like one that runs anywhere,
and the user found out mid-task on a machine with no GPU.

The second contract here is the one that makes the first one safe. Browsing a
catalogue is not a request to contact anything or to start anything: readiness
is answered from local state alone -- `nvidia-smi` is looked for on PATH and
never executed -- so rendering thirty-four rows must not cost a subprocess or a
socket. Asserted by making both an error while the real route runs.
