"""Whether a session pinned to a model configuration can ever be sent to again.

D2 makes a session name the configuration it ran under instead of silently
following whatever is active now, and `bind_model_revision` refuses with 409
`model_revision_unavailable` — "choose one to continue" — when that
configuration is gone. The refusal is right. Nothing could answer it.

The two statements that write `model_profile_id` both sit past the raise, so
the binding could not be changed; `PATCH /frames/{id}` allowlists `name` and
`task_summary`; forking inherits the pin; profile ids are random `mp-<hex>`, so
re-creating the profile under the same name does not match. `app.js` had zero
references to the error code. Deleting a model profile therefore bricked every
session bound to it, permanently — history and artifacts still readable, the
session never sendable again.

Two triggers, and only one of them involves a delete click. The other is a
profile that still exists whose bound *revision* does not: a database predating
the revision history, a rebuilt profile, or seeded builtin profiles dropped the
first time an upgraded database opens Customize → Models.

So: deleting a profile releases what pointed at it, and
`POST /frames/{id}/model-binding` answers the 409 for everything else.

That route exists rather than a flag on send for a specific reason. The client
sends `model: S.defaultModel` on *every* message, so treating a supplied model
as consent to re-pin would rebind silently on every turn — which is exactly the
drift D2 was written to remove. Re-pinning is something a person asks for.
