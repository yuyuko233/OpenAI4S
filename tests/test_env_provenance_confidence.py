"""Whether the environment panel's claim matches what the row can support.

`env_snapshots` carries two columns whose whole purpose is to qualify the
claim. `generation_confidence` is `verified` when the snapshot's address
includes its generation — so no later kernel can share the row — and
`legacy_unverified` when it was written before that was true. `provenance`
carries the fallback path's own words, e.g. "assumed: no kernel generation on
record". The migration that added the confidence column says, in its own
docstring, that "a reader that needs certainty filters on the label".

No reader did. `grep -c generation_confidence app.js` was 0. The panel drew one
distinction — captured vs live — so every captured snapshot rendered as
"Recorded from the kernel environment at the time this artifact was produced",
including the ones the store had explicitly marked as unable to support that.
The label was computed, migrated, stored, and shipped over the wire to be
ignored, which left the UI making the strong claim on the strength of data
saying it should not.

This is the display-layer version of what `capture_environment` was fixed for:
provenance that is wrong rather than absent, which is worse because it gets
believed.

Both halves are checked here — the payload really carries the fields, and the
branch really reads them — because either alone would pass while the panel
stayed wrong.
