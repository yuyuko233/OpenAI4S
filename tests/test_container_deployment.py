"""The container deployment assets, pinned against the code they describe.

A Dockerfile, a compose file and a Kubernetes manifest are configuration for a
program that is free to change underneath them. Nothing in a YAML file fails
when the daemon renames the variable it reads, moves the route a probe polls,
or changes which paths answer without a credential — the deployment simply
stops working, somewhere else, later, for someone who did not make the change.

So these tests do not restate the manifests. Each one ties a value in an asset
to the thing in `openai4s/` that gives it meaning: the probe path to the
gateway's own unauthenticated set, the port to `Config`'s default, the secret
variable to the name the broker derives, the container uid to the account the
image creates. The exceptions are the two properties that are dangerous rather
than merely drift-prone — a single replica, and a published port bound to
loopback — which are asserted because a plausible edit reverses them.

`scripts/container_smoke.sh` is the other half and answers a different
question: whether the image, built and run, actually works. It needs a Docker
daemon and runs as its own CI job.
